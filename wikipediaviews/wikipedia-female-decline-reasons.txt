A few pieces of evidence:

(a) The surveys Issa and I ran showed women as more likely than men to say they use Wikipedia less now than earlier, and also reported lower absolute use of Wikipedia than for men
(b) One reason I suspect for the decline of Wikipedia pageviews is social media (where people tend to link to Wikipedia less), and women use social media more
(c) Wikipedia is not as good for topics women are more interested in, including stuff like recipes, fashion tips, etc. (it's good at celebrity stuff but not great). There have been a lot of new websites and apps related to these in the last few years, so Wikipedia use is probably declining
(d) Developing countries, where Wikipedia use has increased more in the last few years, have a stronger pro-male gender skew in Wikipedia use
