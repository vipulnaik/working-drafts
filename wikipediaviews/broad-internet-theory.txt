Initial impetus to join Internet: information (encyclopedias, maps, whatever), transactions (e-commerce, registrations, payments, club memberships), public interaction (forums, mailing lists), private communication (email)

The first billion users were selected to be more interested in using online information sources. Ideal environment in which search engines and Wikipedia could boom

Later users sought one-stop information solution, but focused more on communication. Didn't really care about structure of Internet, open Internet.

Thus, they not only failed to contribute to Wikipedia traffic, they also changed emphasis of Internet so that even many of early users are spending more time in communications tools and less on getting information online
