Below, we estimate traffic that Wikipedia generates for external sites.

I originally wanted to do this as a response to people who claim that
placing links on Wikipedia generates a lot of revenue for the
link-placers. At this point I don't think there is a point in
responding to the original discussion, but this seems to be of
independent interest.

## issarice.com

https://www.google.com/search?q=issarice.com+site%3Awikipedia.org&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8 overlists pages.

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&profile=all&search=issarice.com&fulltext=1 underlists pages (only lists two of four links).

Four links:

* User:Riceissa
* GiveWell (page deleted)
* Dustin Moskovitz (reference to Cari Tuna)
* User:Shaddim
* User talk:Riceissa

Traffic data en.wikipedia.org -> issarice.com: https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#report/trafficsources-referrals/a54798318w87799141p91155095/%3F_u.date00%3D20150208%26_u.date01%3D20170310%26explorer-table.plotKeys%3D%5B%5D%26_r.drilldown%3Danalytics.source%3Aen.wikipedia.org%26explorer-graphOptions.selected%3Danalytics.nthMonth%26explorer-segmentExplorer.segmentId%3Danalytics.landingPagePath/

Data: 69 sessions, 2.75 pages/session.

Upshot: CTR to issarice.com from these three user pages, in total, is about 1%. Maybe it's a bit higher, considering that some of the pages added the link later and we're considering lifetime pageviews. Or maybe lower, if some of the Wikipedia-sourced stuff is fake or referrer spam (or from pages we can't locate offhand).

Also for specific links:

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dustin_Moskovitz&diff=740677347&oldid=740675683 added link to https://issarice.com/cari-tuna from page on Dustin Moskovitz on September 22, 2016.

The page has had about 270K pageviews since then, see https://wikipediaviews.org/displayviewsformultiplemonths.php?page=Dustin+Moskovitz&months[0]=201702&months[1]=201701&months[2]=201612&months[3]=201611&months[4]=201610&language=en&drilldown=all and generated 4 visits to issarice.com.

So the CTR works out to 0.0015%.

The page on GiveWell had an addition of a link to https://issarice.com/givewell-staff-growth sometime between July and December 2016 (don't know exactly when, as page is deleted). Page has had about 10K pageviews since then, and generated zero clicks. This is consistent with the low CTR.
