Below, we estimate traffic that Wikipedia generates for external sites.

I originally wanted to do this as a response to people who claim that
placing links on Wikipedia generates a lot of revenue for the
link-placers. At this point I don't think there is a point in
responding to the original discussion, but this seems to be of
independent interest.

## issarice.com

https://www.google.com/search?q=issarice.com+site%3Awikipedia.org&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8 overlists pages.

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&profile=all&search=issarice.com&fulltext=1 underlists pages (only lists two of four links).

Four links:

* User:Riceissa
* GiveWell (page deleted)
* User:Shaddim
* User talk:Riceissa

Total traffic to these pages: 118,000 pageviews.

However, most of this is to the deleted GiveWell page, which sent no traffic to issarice.com. That leaves three pages, that had a total of 13,417 pageviews, of which about 6,250 were non-spider views.

Traffic data en.wikipedia.org -> issarice.com: https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#report/trafficsources-referrals/a54798318w87799141p91155095/%3F_u.date00%3D20150208%26_u.date01%3D20170310%26explorer-table.plotKeys%3D%5B%5D%26_r.drilldown%3Danalytics.source%3Aen.wikipedia.org%26explorer-graphOptions.selected%3Danalytics.nthMonth%26explorer-segmentExplorer.segmentId%3Danalytics.landingPagePath/

Data: 69 sessions, 2.75 pages/session.

Upshot: CTR to issarice.com from these three user pages, in total, is about 1%. Maybe it's a bit higher, considering that some of the pages added the link later and we're considering lifetime pageviews.
