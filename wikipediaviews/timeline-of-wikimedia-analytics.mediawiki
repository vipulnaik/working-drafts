! Time period !! Development summary !! More details
|-
| January 2001 to December 8, 2007 || Basically, no statistics are available that survive in the long term. ||
|-
| December 9, 2007 to June 29, 2009 || Wikipedia has only a desktop site, and pageviews data is being collected || Pageview data is generated using "pagecounts-raw" and accessible using stats.grok.se, starting with the English Wikipedia on December 10, 2007 and other language Wikipedias on February 1, 2008.
|-
| June 30, 2009 to early 2014 || Wikipedia launches a mobile site, but mobile pageviews go down a black hole and bots/spiders aren't excluded. || The "pagecounts-raw" dump, and stats.grok.se, do ''not'' include mobile pageviews. This makes the statistics increasingly inaccurate as mobile usage of Wikipedia increases. Starting June 2010, ''total'' mobile usage of each of the language Wikipedias is tracked, but page-level data is not present.
|-
| March 2014 onward || The Wikimedia Foundation revamps its datasets, making progress on tracking mobile and excluding bots/spiders. || Starting March 2014, problems with the WebStatsCollector (used to generate pagecounts-raw) are logged regularly. A new data dump, "pagecount-all-sites", is available for data starting September 23, 2014. For data starting May 1, 2015, a "pageviews" dataset is available. The Wikimedia API allows access to pageview information (broken down by agent type and access type) starting July 1, 2015. The definitions continue to be adjusted till early 2016.

| 2016 || February || Outbound traffic measurement || The Wikimedia Foundation rolls out an update to the HTTPS meta referrer policy, that reveals the Origin rather than the full path of the referring domain. This means that websites that receive traffic from Wikipedia can once again calculate how much traffic they are receiving from Wikipedia, an ability that was lost in the switch to HTTPS. However, unlike the pre-HTTPS situation, full referral paths are not accessible, so websites cannot know what Wikipedia pages are sending traffic to them.
