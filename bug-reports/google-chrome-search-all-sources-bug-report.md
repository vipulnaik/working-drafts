# Google Chrome: search all sources bug report

## Bug report meta

I used `Help > Report an Issue` in Google Chrome to report this
bug. The text I paste below is a copy of what I put in the text box
for the bug. I also attached a screenshot for illustrative purposes.

## Bug report text

I’m using Chrome on a Mac. For my regular Chrome (Chrome 112), in
Chrome Developer Tools, when I try to search across all sources using
Cmd+Option+F, I do not actually see the search bar in which to
type. When I run Chrome in incognito, hitting Cmd+Option+F to search
across all sources shows a search bar, and I can use it to
successfully search across all sources.

I’ve noticed this bug a few months ago but did not report it, hoping
that subsequent iterations of Chrome would fix it. I don’t remember
exactly when the bug started. I’ve attached a screenshot of Developer
Tools for my regular Chrome after I click Cmd+Option+F; you can see
the drawer for Search has opened but there’s no Search bar.

I also checked on a different Mac (Intel Mac) and I see the same bug
there as well.

I see the error even after I deactivate all my Chrome extensions.

I’ve tried several page urls, including brand new tabs with no page
loaded, and always run into the same issue.
