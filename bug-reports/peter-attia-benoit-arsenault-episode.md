## Message text

In the Benoit Arsenault podcast episode (#210), Peter says:

> An easy way to think about this would be if you give a statin and let’s say in the most aggressive case, the Lp(a) goes up by 10%, but the apoB comes down by 60%, you’d have to make the case that an Lp(a) is 6-times more atherogenic on a particle for particle basis for that to be an equivalence maneuver.

This is incorrect because the number of Lp(a) particles is much less than the number of apoB particles, and for a true equivalence maneuver we would need to adjust for that difference.

Let's say starting Lp(a) is 100 nmol/L, and starting apoB is 110 mg/dL, which would roughly translate to about 2000 nmol/L using a molecular weight of 550,000 for apoB100. We are then comparing an increase of 10 nmol/L in Lp(a) and a decrease of 1200 nmol/L in apoB. This means that on a particle-by-particle case, the Lp(a) would have to be 1200/10 = 120 times as atherogenic as the apoB particle, rather than 6 times as Peter says.
