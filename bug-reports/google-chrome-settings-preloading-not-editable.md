# Google Chrome: settings preloading not editable bug report

## Bug report meta

I used `Help > Report an Issue` in Google Chrome to report this
bug. The text I paste below is a copy of what I put in the text box
for the bug. I also attached a screenshot for illustrative purposes.

I submitted the bug report on 2023-05-14 around 9:45 AM PDT.

I checked all three checkboxes:

* We may email you for more information and updates
* Include this screenshot and titles of open tabs (though I made sure to close other open tabs before starting the reporting process)
* Send system information

## Bug report text

I can't edit the settings at chrome://settings/preloading

The settings are grayed out and do not respond to being clicked.
