''''''Tenrec v. USCIS''''', colloquially known as the '''H-1B Lottery Lawsuit''', was a class action lawsuit brought against [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] challenging the [[H-1B visa]] lottery process. The plaintiffs were two pairs of H-1B petitioner (employer) and beneficiary (prospective employee): petitioner Tenrec, Inc. with beneficiary Sergii Sinieno, and petitioner Walker Mary LLC with beneficiary Xiaoyang Zhu. The case was decided against the petitioners, and an appeal was withdrawn after both petitioning companies withdrew.

{{further|H-1B visa#Evolution of the program}}

=== Legislative caps ===

The H-1B visa was introduced in its present form by the [[Immigration Act of 1990]], with an annual cap of 65,000 for temporary skilled workers. The quotas apply for each Fiscal Year, that begins in October of the previous calendar year. [[Form I-129]] petitions can be filed at most six months in advance of the start date, so the start date for filing petitions for a given Fiscal Year is April of the preceding calendar year.The most recent legislation changing the caps was the [[H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004]] (passed December 6, 2004), which added 20,000 cap-exempt slots for workers with United States masters degrees.<ref name=caa05>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-108publ447/html/PLAW-108publ447.htm|title = Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005|publisher = [[United States Government Publishing Office]]|date = December 8, 2004|accessdate = March 29, 2015}}</ref><ref name=uslawnet>{{cite web|url=http://www.uslawnet.com/englishhome/news/messages/199.htm|title = H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004 -- H.R.4818|last = Xie|first = Jeff|date = December 21, 2004|accessdate = March 29, 2015|publisher = uslawnet.com, Xie Law Offices, LLC}}</ref><ref name=uscis-press-release>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/pressrelease/H-1B_12_9_04.pdf|title = USCIS TO IMPLEMENT H-1B VISA REFORM ACT OF 2004|date = December 9, 2004|accessdate = March 29, 2015|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}</ref>

=== Lottery process ===

The USCIS published a regulation in the ''[[Federal Register]]'' on May 5, 2005, describing its process for deciding which of the H-1B [[Form I-129]] petitions it received in a given Fiscal Year it would adjudicate, while staying within the legislatively determined cap of 65,000 + 20,000. The regulation stated that all petitions ''before'' the date of crossing the cap would be adjudicated, whereas petitions received on the day of hitting the cap would be subjected to a lottery to select just the right number that would hit the cap. USCIS would not accept further petitions in that Fiscal Year. Moreover, petitions where the beneficiary had a U.S. Masters degree would be counted against the 20,000 limit first, and if that limit was hit before the 65,000 general limit, further such petitions would be counted against the 65,000 limit.<ref name=uscis-lottery-regulation>{{cite web|url = https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2005/05/05/05-8992/allocation-of-additional-h-1b-visas-created-by-the-h-1b-visa-reform-act-of-2004|title = 70 FR 23775 - ALLOCATION OF ADDITIONAL H-1B VISAS CREATED BY THE H-1B VISA REFORM ACT OF 2004|date = May 5, 2005|accessdate = August 13, 2017|publisher = ''Federal Register''</ref><ref name=uscis-lottery-regulation-gpo>{{cite web|url = https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/FR-2005-05-05/05-8992/content-detail.html|title = 70 FR 23775 - ALLOCATION OF ADDITIONAL H-1B VISAS CREATED BY THE H-1B VISA REFORM ACT OF 2004|date = May 5, 2005|accessdate = August 13, 2017|publisher = U.S. Government Programming Office}}</ref> Petitions that were submitted later, or that were submitted on the last date and did not win the lottery for the last date, would get no preferential treatment in later years.<ref name=nlr-lottery-lawsuit/>

In Fiscal Year 2008, the USCIS received enough cap-subject petitions to hit its cap within the first two working days of April, and had to put all petitions through a lottery to select which ones to adjudicate.<ref name=fy-08-h-1b-lottery>{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/pressrelease/H1BFY08Cap040307.pdf|title = USCIS Reached FY 2008 H-1B Cap|date = April 3, 2007|accessdate = August 12, 2017|publisher = United States Citizenship and Immigration Services}}</ref> To reduce pressure on overnight courier services and USCIS service centers, USCIS changed its selection process effective Fiscal Year 2009: it would now receive cap-subject petitions for at least the five working days of April, and, if it received enough petitions in that period, it would stop receiving applications and select petitions to adjudicate by putting all received petitions through a lottery.<ref name=nlr-lottery-lawsuit>{{cite web|url = https://www.natlawreview.com/article/controversial-h-1b-lottery-upheld|title = Controversial H-1B Lottery Upheld|last = Koski|first = Ceridwen|date = March 28, 2017|accessdate = August 13, 2017|publisher = ''The National Law Review''}}</ref>
