The '''Interview Waiver Program''' ('''IWP'''), also called the '''Visa Interview Waiver Program''', is a program managed by the [[U.S. Department of State]]'s [[Bureau of Consular Affairs]] under which, under some circumstances, interview requirements can be waived for some nonimmigrant visa applicants. The program has basis in the guidelines provided in the ''[[Foreign Affairs Manual]]'' 9 FAM 403.5.<ref name=fam-9-403-5>{{cite web|url = https://fam.state.gov/fam/09FAM/09FAM040305.html|title = 9 FAM 403.5 (U) NIV INTERVIEW BY CONSULAR OFFICER (part of the Foreign Affairs Manual)|publisher = [[U.S. Department of State]]|accessdate = January 29, 2017}}</ref> As of December 2022, some of the temporary cases of the Interview Waiver Program were extended to December 31, 2023 (this is in addition to the cases that have no set expiration, that are expected to continue beyond December 31, 2023).<ref name=iwp-extended-to-december-2023>{{cite web|url = https://www.state.gov/extension-of-interview-waivers-for-certain-nonimmigrant-visa-applicants/|title = Extension of Interview Waivers for Certain Nonimmigrant Visa Applicants|date = December 23, 2022|accessdate = October 11, 2023|publisher = U.S. Department of State}}</ref><ref name=fam-9-403-5/>

Applicants qualifying for interview waivers generally need to submit their passport along with various documentation to the US embassy or consulate processing their case. In some jurisdictions, the location that applicants submit the passport and documentation is called a "dropbox" location, and the terms "dropbox" or "dropbox appointment" may be used instead of "interview waiver" in some contexts.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.ustraveldocs.com/lk/lk-niv-visarenew.asp|title = Interview Waiver & Visa Renewal (Sri Lanka)|accessdate = October 12, 2023|publisher = USTravelDocs}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.ustraveldocs.com/vn/vn-niv-typej.asp|title = Exchange Visitor Visa (Vietnam)|accessdate = October 12, 2023|publisher = USTravelDocs}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://visagrader.com/trackers/us-drop-box-visa-appointments|title = US Visa Dropbox Appointment Experiences Tracker|publisher = Visa Grader|accessdate = October 12, 2023}}</ref>

== Guidance for the Interview Waiver Program provided in the Foreign Affairs Manual ==

According to the ''[[Foreign Affairs Manual]]'' (FAM), 9 FAM 403.5-4, a consular officer may choose to waive an interview for a visa applicant if any of the below conditions apply. Some of the content of the FAM is not available to the public. The guidance offers considerable leeway for consulates and consular officers regarding whether to grant interview waivers; it only provides a set of necessary conditions that must be satisfied in order to grant an interview waiver.<ref name=fam-9-403-5/>

=== Interview waiver based on age (9 FAM 403.5-2) ===

* In the case of F, M, and J applicants, the applicant's SEVIS record must indicate an "initial" or "active" status.

=== Interview waiver for H-2A and H-2B applicants (until December 31, 2023) (9 FAM 403.5-4(A)(1)(a)(4)) ===

== Implementation ==

The Interview Waiver Program works as follows. Applicants apply for a visa by filling in Form DS-160 online on the Department of State's Consular Electronic Application Center website, just as they would for a visa application with an interview. After submitting Form DS-160, the applicant may then use the Form DS-160 confirmation number to apply for a nonimmigrant visa at the consulate. As of 2023, the website through which nonimmigrant visa applications for US consulates can be done electronically is ustraveldocs.com.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.ustraveldocs.com/|title = USTravelDocs|accessdate = October 11, 2023}}</ref> The visa application process on this site includes a bunch of questions for the applicant, and based on the applicant's answers to the questions, the application informs the applicant whether he or she may be eligible for an interview waiver.

== History ==

=== Rollout ===

The Interview Waiver Program has been rolled out gradually starting around 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://photos.state.gov/libraries/nogales/231771/PDFs/Beginning%20January%2010.pdf|title = Beginning January 10, 2011, the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will process visas differently|accessdate = January 29, 2017}}</ref> The rollout has been incremental along two dimensions: the set of embassies and consulates where it is available, and the criteria for which an interview waiver is provided.

The IWP became available in [[India]] in March 2012 and its scope in India was expanded in November 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/interview-waiver-program-makes-visa-renewal-simpler/article3702254.ece|title = 'Interview Waiver Program' makes visa renewal simpler|newspaper = [[The Hindu]]|accessdate = January 29, 2017}}</ref>

The Interview Waiver Program became permanent in January 2014.<ref name=bond-statement/>

In a prepared statement at a hearing at the [[United States Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Competitiveness, Innovation, and Export Promotion|United States Senate Subcommittee on Tourism, Competitiveness, and Innovation]] on June 26, 2014, the [[U.S. Department of State]] Acting Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs talked about the department's efforts to continue expanding the Interview Waiver Program to more applicants and use cases through better fraud detection techniques. One of the examples she gave was making citizens of [[Visa Waiver Program]] member countries eligible for the IWP when applying for other nonimmigrant visas. The statement also said that the Department of State looked forward to working with the [[United States Congress]] to pass legislation that would enable the Department of State and [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] to expand the program further.<ref name=bond-statement>{{cite web|url = https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/about/speeches-testimonies/Hearing-on-Travel-Facilitation.html|title = 06-26-2014: Statement of Michele T.

In November 2015, the IWP was expanded in India to cover people with [[H-1B visa]]s whose employer had changed.{{citation needed}}

IWP was still being rolled out to additional countries as of 2016.<ref name=algeria>{{cite web|url = https://photos.state.gov/libraries/algeria/401501/pdf2016/2016-04-10_Visa_Interview_Waiver_Program_EN.pdf|title = Visa Interview Program Launched!|date = April 11, 2016|accessdate = January 29, 2017|publisher = Embassy of the United States of America in Algiera, Algeria}}</ref>

=== Suspension ===

An [[Executive Order 13769|executive order by Donald Trump on January 27, 2017]], issued a week after [[Donald Trump]] assumed the office of [[President of the United States]], asked for an immediate suspension of the Interview Waiver Program, pending review for compliance with Section 222 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1222, which requires that all individuals seeking a nonimmigrant visa undergo an in-person interview, subject to specific statutory exceptions.<ref name=qz>{{cite news|url = https://qz.com/895149/trump-is-suspending-the-visa-interview-waiver-program/|title = Trump just made it harder for tourists to visit the US|last = Yanofsky|first = David|date = January 27, 2017|accessdate = January 29, 2017|work = [[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]}}</ref><ref name=cnn>{{cite web|url = https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/27/politics/donald-trump-refugees-executive-order/index.html|title = Trump's latest executive order: Banning people from 7 countries and more|last = Diamond|first = Jeremy|publisher = [[CNN]]|date = January 29, 2017|accessdate = January 29, 2017}}</ref> Dara Lind of ''Vox'' referred to the suspension of the IWP as the only concrete change to the visa screening process in Trump's executive order.<ref name=vox>{{cite web|url = https://www.vox.com/2017/1/27/14370854/trump-refugee-ban-order-muslim|title = Trump's executive order on refugees closes America to those who need it most.

At around the same time as the executive order, Trump fired many key executives of the [[U.S. Department of State]], including [[Michele Thoren Bond]], who had delivered the statement about IWP in June 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/29/state-department-purge-trump-foreign-policy|title =  Trump's state department purge sparks worries of 'know-nothing approach' to foreign policy.
