Some ideas of pages to create:

* Credit elect (US taxes / IRS jargon, but the concept is likely wider)
* Escape from Kabul (HBO/BBC(?) documentary)
* Urduwood
* Food neutrality (maybe link out from body positivity etc.)
* Korea discount (stub already exists on Korean Wikipedia with the transliteration of the name: https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%BD%94%EB%A6%AC%EC%95%84_%EB%94%94%EC%8A%A4%EC%B9%B4%EC%9A%B4%ED%8A%B8)
* Kimchi premium
