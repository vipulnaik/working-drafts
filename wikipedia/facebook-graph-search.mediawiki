[[File:Facebook Graph Search.jpg|thumb|Facebook Graph Search feature]]
'''Facebook Graph Search''' was a [[semantic search]] engine that was introduced by [[Facebook]] in March 2013. It was designed to give answers to user [[Natural language processing|natural language]] queries rather than a list of links.<ref name="TechCrunch">{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/15/facebook-announces-its-third-pillar-graph-search/ |title=Facebook Announces Its Third Pillar "Graph Search" That Gives You Answers, Not Links Like Google |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=15 January 2013 |work= |publisher=TechCrunch |accessdate=16 January 2013}}</ref> The name refers to the [[social graph]] nature of Facebook, which maps the relationships among users. The Graph Search feature combined the [[big data]] acquired from its over one billion users and external data into a search engine providing user-specific search results. In a presentation headed by Facebook CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]], it was announced that the Graph Search algorithm finds information from within a user's network of friends.  Additional results were provided by [[Microsoft]]'s [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] search engine.<ref>{{cite news|title=Facebook introduces social search feature|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/facebook-introduces-social-search-feature/2013/01/15/599c6f7e-5f3d-11e2-9940-6fc488f3fecd_story.html |publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=16 January 2013|first=Hayley|last=Tsukayama|date=January 15, 2013}}</ref> In July it was made available to all users using the [[American English|U.S. English]] version of Facebook.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/facebook-graph-search-bit-better-bit-scarier-mostly-just-different-6C10578730 Facebook Graph Search] by Rosa Golijan, NBC News, July 9, 2013</ref> After being made less publicly visible starting December 2014, the original Graph Search was almost entirely deprecated in June 2019.<ref name=vice-shutdown-announcement/>

==History==

===Initial development===

The feature was developed under former Google employees [[Lars Rasmussen (software developer)|Lars Rasmussen]] and [[Tom Stocky]].<ref name="TechCrunch"/>

The Graph Search Features was launched in [[Software release life cycle|Beta]] January 2013 as a limited preview for some English users in the United States.<ref name="Van Grove 2013">Van Grove, J. (2013, January 15). Facebook Graph Search: First Impressions. CNET.</ref><ref name="Stocky-2013-01">{{cite web|last1=Stocky|first1=Tom|last2=Rasmussen|first2=Lars|title=Introducing Graph Search Beta|url=https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2013/01/introducing-graph-search-beta/|website=Newsroom|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=27 September 2016|date=15 January 2013}}</ref> Company reports indicate that the service launched to between tens and hundreds of thousands of users.

The feature has been released only to limited users, with a slow expansion planned. Facebook announced plans for a future mobile interface and the inclusion of Instagram photos.<ref name="techcrunch.com">Olanoff, Drew, Josh Constine, Colleen Taylor and Ingrid Lunden. (15 Jan. 2013).

AOL Tech. < https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/15/facebook-announces-its-third-pillar-graph-search/>.</ref>

In late September 2013, Facebook announced that it would begin rolling out search for posts and comments as part of Graph Search.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.fb.com/News/728/Graph-Search-Now-Includes-Posts-and-Status-Updates|title = Graph Search Now Includes Posts and Status Updates|date = September 20, 2013|accessdate = January 21, 2014|publisher = [[Facebook]]}}</ref><ref name=tc-post-search>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/30/graph-search-posts/|title = Facebook Starts Rollout Of Graph Search For Posts, Comments, Check-Ins To Reveal The Past And Present|date = September 30, 2013|accessdate = January 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://allfacebook.com/screenshots-search-for-posts_b136826|title=SCREENSHOTS: Facebook’s New Search Feature|work=allfacebook.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2013/09/30/facebook-rolling-out-graph-search-feature-that-helps-you-find-posts-and-status-updates/|title=Facebook Graph Search Now Helps You Find Posts And Status Updates|author=Ken Yeung|work=The Next Web}}</ref> The rollout began in October 2013, but many people who had Graph Search were not given immediate access to this feature.<ref name=tc-post-search/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2298605/Facebook-Graph-Search-Now-Lets-You-Search-for-Posts-Status-Updates-Check-ins-Comments|title = Facebook Graph Search Now Lets You Search for Posts, Status Updates, Check-ins, Comments|last = Slegg|first = Jennifer|date = October 3, 2013|accessdate = January 21, 2014}}</ref> A post on the Facebook Engineering blog explained that the huge amount of post and comment data, coming to a total of 700 TB, meant that developing Graph Search for posts was substantially more challenging than the original Graph Search.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/under-the-hood-building-posts-search/10151755593228920|title = Under the Hood: Building posts search|publisher = Facebook Engineering|date = October 24, 2013|accessdate = January 21, 2014}}</ref>

=== Removal from public visibility from December 2014 onward ===

In December 2014, Facebook changed its search features, dropping partnership with Bing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/12/13/facebook-nixes-bing-graph-search/|title=Facebook's updated search tool leaves out Bing results|author=Mariella Moon|publisher=AOL|work=Engadget}}</ref> Around the same time, Facebook changed the way searches could be done through the website and app, obscuring some of the previous graph search functionality, but most of the functionality was still available through direct construction of the search urls.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://booleanblackbelt.com/2015/02/important-facebook-graph-search-developments/|title = Important Facebook Graph Search Developments|date = February 1, 2015|accessdate = June 15, 2019}}</ref>

Over the next few years, the online intelligence community, investigative journalists, and criminal investigators would develop tools and practices to more effectively use Facebook Graph Search despite it not being publicly visible.<ref name=vice-shutdown-announcement/> One of these, Stalkscan, would receive media attention.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://lifehacker.com/stalkscan-reveals-all-your-facebook-info-thats-availabl-1792471806|title = Stalkscan Reveals All the Info You Can Search for on Facebook|date = February 17, 207|accessdate = June 15, 2019|publisher = Lifehacker}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://fossbytes.com/stalkscan-exposes-facebook-information-public/|title = Stalkscan Is A Creepy Tool That Exposes All Your Facebook Public Information In One Click|last = Verma|first = Adarsh|date = February 15, 2017|accessdate = June 15, 2019}}</ref> Graph.tips was a frequently used tool in the online intelligence community as an interface on top of Facebook Graph Search.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://researchclinic.net/graph.html|title = Facebook Graph Searching|accessdate = June 15, 2019}}</ref><ref name=gijn>{{cite web|url = https://gijn.org/online-research-tools/|title = Online Research Tools|publisher = Global Investigative Journalism Network|accessdate = June 15, 2019}}</ref><ref name=vice-shutdown-announcement/>

=== Deprecation of most functionality in June 2019 === 

In early June 2019, the feature was further deprecated, with the majority of urls for graph search queries no longer working.<ref name=vice-shutdown-announcement>{{cite web|url = https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmpgmx/facebook-stops-graph-search|title = Facebook Quietly Changes Search Tool Used by Investigators, Abused By Companies. Facebook’s Graph Search allowed anyone to search a wealth of public data on Facebook in very specific ways, such as searching content for keywords in a particular point in time.|date = June 10, 2019|accessdate = June 15, 2019|publisher = ''Vice''|last = Cox|first = Joseph}}</ref> Facebook explained this by saying: "The vast majority of people on Facebook search using keywords, a factor which led us to pause some aspects of graph search and focus more on improving keyword search. We are working closely with researchers to make sure they have the tools they need to use our platform."<ref name=vice-shutdown-announcement/><ref name=techcrunch-shutdown-announcement>{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/10/changes-to-facebook-graph-search-leaves-online-investigators-in-a-lurch/|title = Changes to Facebook Graph Search leaves online investigators in a lurch|last = Shu|first = Catherine|date = June 10, 2019|accessdate = June 15, 2019|publisher = ''TechCrunch''}}</ref> However, there was speculation that the shutdown of Graph Search may also have been motivated by privacy concerns.<ref name=vice-shutdown-announcement/>

Many tools that depended on Facebook Graph Search, including Stalkscan and graph.tips, had much of their functionality stop working, though some tools were updated using complicated workarounds for some queries.<ref name=vice-shutdown-announcement/> ''Vice'' quoted [[Bellingcat]]'s Nick Waters as saying: "Now that Graph Search has gone down, it's become evident that it's used by some incredibly important section[s] of society, from human rights investigators and citizens wanting to hold their countries to account, to police investigating people trafficking and sexual slavery, to emergency responders."<ref name=vice-shutdown-announcement/>

==Operation==

Graph Search operated by use of a [[search algorithm]] similar to traditional search engines such as Google. However, the search feature is distinguished as a semantic search engine, searching based on intended meaning. Rather than returning results based on matching keywords, the search engine is designed to match phrases, as well as objects on the site.<ref name="ReferenceA">Van Grove, J. (2013, January 15). Facebook takes on Google with Graph Search. CNET.</ref>

Search results were based on both the content of the user and their friends’ profiles and the relationships between the user and their friends. Results were based on the friends and interests expressed on Facebook, and also shaped by users’ privacy settings. In addition to being restricted from seeing some content, users could sometimes view relevant content made publicly available by users not listed as friends.<ref name="facebook.com">{{cite web|title=How Privacy Works with Graph Search|url=https://www.facebook.com/about/graphsearch/privacy|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=10 October 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116162543/https://www.facebook.com/about/graphsearch/privacy|archivedate=16 January 2013|date=2013}}</ref>

Entries into the search bar were auto-completed as users typed, with Facebook suggesting friends and second degree connections, Facebook pages, automatically-generated topics, and Web searches for anything Facebook was not able to search for.<ref>Bea, F. (2013, January 25). Hands on: Facebook Graph Search digs deep, even if it doesn’t always strike gold. Digital Trends. <http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/hands-on-with-facebook-graph-search/>.</ref>

The operation of the search feature depended on user involvement. The feature was intended to encourage users to add more friends, more quickly. In doing so, it could provide updating, more data-rich results and stimulate use of the feature.<ref name="Van Grove 2013"/>

=== Search functions ===
Facebook supported searches for the following types:
* People
* Pages
* Places (limitable to a specific location (latitude and longitude) and distance)
* Check-ins of the user, friends, or where user or friends have been tagged
* Objects with location information attached. In addition, the returned objects will be those in which the user or friends have been tagged, or those objects that were created by the user or friends.
* 
Users could filter results, such as in time (since and until), or search only a given user's News feed and much more new.

The feature also allowed users to search the web directly.<ref name="developers.facebook.com">"Search – Facebook Developers" (2013). Facebook. <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/search/>.</ref>

===Examples===
Tom Stocky of the search team offered several examples of potential queries during the launch presentation, including,
* "Friends who Like Star Wars and Harry Potter"
* For setting up a potential date, "Who are single men in San Francisco and are from India"
* For employee recruiting, "NASA employees who are friends with people at Facebook"
* For browsing photos or planning travel, "photos of my friends taken at National Parks"<ref name="techcrunch.com"/>

During its roll-out stage, bloggers showed how Facebook Graph Search could be used to uncover potentially embarrassing information (e.g., companies employing people who like racism) or illegal interests (e.g., [[China|Chinese]] residents who like the banned group [[Falun Gong]]).<ref>{{cite web|last=Oremus|first=Will|title=The Funny, Embarrassing, and Disturbing Ways People Can Use Facebook's New Search Tool|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/01/23/actual_facebook_graph_searches_tom_scott_s_tumblr_a_privacy_wake_up_call.html|accessdate=23 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Mlot|first=Stephanie|title=Bizarre Facebook Graph Search Results Get the Tumblr Treatment|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2414599,00.asp|accessdate=23 January 2013|work=PC Magazine}}</ref>

Microsoft was partnered with Facebook to provide search results from 2008 to 2014. Microsoft Live Search came to be known as [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] following the initiation of the partnership. In 2010, Facebook and Bing partnered to offer socially-oriented search results: ‘People Search’ and ‘Liked by your Facebook Friends’ information appeared in results within Facebook and on [[Bing.com]].<ref>Ballard, Mark. (31 Jan. 2013). "Will Facebook’s Graph Search Be Big For Bing Advertisers?" Search Engine Land. < http://searchengineland.com/will-facebooks-graph-search-be-big-for-bing-advertisers-146921>.</ref>

In May 2012, Bing launched a social sidebar feature which displayed Facebook content alongside of search results. Promoted on the basis of asking friends for advice, the feature allows users to broadcast queries related to their searches to Facebook friends, and offers recommendations of Facebook friends, as well as experts from other networks who could be capable of offering insight.<ref>"Introducing the New Bing: Spend Less Time Searching, More Time Doing". (10 May 2012). Bing. Microsoft, Inc. <http://www.bing.com/community/site_blogs/b/search/archive/2012/05/10/spend-less-time-searching-more-time-doing-introducing-the-new-bing.aspx>.</ref>

The previously developed Instant Personalization feature integrated friends’ publicly available information, such as likes, into content on other external websites, such as Rotten Tomatoes and Yelp.<ref>"Instant Personalization" (2013). Facebook. <https://www.facebook.com/instantpersonalization/>.</ref>

The emergence of the Graph Search feature builds on this partnership. Facebook content remains on Bing.com. The focus of Graph Search is internal content, but Bing continues to issue search results of external content. The external search results are based on traditional keyword-match.<ref name=Larepublica.pe>[http://larepublica.pe/15-01-2013/facebook-lanza-un-buscador-social-que-filtra-contenido-compartido Facebook launches a "social" search engine that filters contents of shared content (In Spanish).] http://larepublica.pe</ref>

==Advertising==
In 2012, Facebook introduced sponsored pages in search results. By buying "Targeted Entities" on Facebook, advertisers pay to have their page appear when users search for that entity.<ref>Wilson, Emily. (31 Jan. 2013). "Facebook Sponsored Results: An Under-Explored Opportunity". MarketingLand. AOL Tech. < http://marketingland.com/facebook-sponsored-results-31940>.</ref> Facebook CEO Zuckerberg reported that this would remain a feature of the search feature, but that the advertising component had not been extended in the Graph Search feature.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Criticisms arose about the integrity of search results on the basis of "buying likes". This practice refers to situations in which companies, without sponsoring results, accumulate a large number of "likes" through practices such as promotions or paying to operate bot accounts. Critics argued that this rendered results allegedly based on other users’ opinions meaningless.<ref name="businessinsider.com">Carlson, Nicholas. (17 Jan. 2013). "Facebook's Search Is Based On A 'Con'." Business Insider. <http://www.businessinsider.com/facebooks-search-results-will-be-totally-irrelevant-because-likes-are-50-fake-2013-1>.</ref>

==Open Graph==
The Open Graph feature allows developers to integrate their [[application software|applications]] and pages into the Facebook platform, and links Facebook with external sites on the Internet. The feature operates by allowing the addition of [[metadata]] to turn websites into graph objects. Actions made using the app are expressed on users’ profile pages.<ref>"Open Graph Overview" (2013). Facebook. <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/concepts/opengraph/overview/>.</ref>

==Privacy==
