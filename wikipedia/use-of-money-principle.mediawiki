The '''use-of-money principle''', also written as the '''use of money principle''', is a principle invoked in the context of [[taxation in the United States]], that states that the government can charge interest for unpaid tax only if the government did ''not'' have use of that tax money (i.e., continuous possession of the money). In other words, interest can only be charged on the amount of tax that is both due and unpaid, regardless of whether the taxpayer has fulfilled other obligations, such as filing a tax return.<ref name=thetaxadviser>{{cite web|url = https://www.thetaxadviser.com/issues/2022/mar/analyzing-difference-tax-payments-deposits.html|title = Analyzing the difference between tax payments and deposits|last = Keenan|first = John|last2 = Cooper|first2 = Matt|last3 = Abney|first3 = Teresa|publisher = The Tax Adviser|date = March 1, 2022|accessdate = September 9, 2023}}</ref><ref name=irm-part-20-penalty-and-interest>{{cite web|url = https://www.irs.gov/irm/part20/irm_20-002-005r|title = Part 20.

==Granularity of accounts==

===Separation of accounts by time period (tax year)===

The [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS, the agency that handles federal taxation) has generally taken the view that the use-of-money principle for a given taxpayer is to be applied separately for each tax year. In other words, an overpayment for one year cannot cancel an underpayment for another year, so that the taxpayer is still responsible for interest on the latter. Payments can be moved across years only if the taxpayer does a credit elect transfer; a credit elect transfer can be done when timely-filing taxes, and it moves the tax overpayment from the tax year to the next one. In the view of the IRS, once the credit elect transfer is done, the money is no longer available in the account for the original year. Therefore, if a later amendment by the taxpayer or audit by the IRS leads to the determination of additional tax liability for the original year, then the amount transferred to future years is not in "use" for that tax liability. So, the taxpayer may have to pay interest for the entire period despite the IRS having the money with it, but tied to a later year.<ref name=thetaxadviser/><ref name=mtl/>

Taxpayers have challenged this interpretation in the courts, and courts have had a mixed response, siding with the IRS in some cases and against the IRS in others:

* ''FleetBoston Fin. Corp. v. United States'' (2007):<ref name=caselaw-fleetboston>{{cite web|url = https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-federal-circuit/1098241.html|title = FLEETBOSTON FINANCIAL CORPORATION v. UNITED STATES (2007)|date = April 19, 2007|accessdate = March 10, 2024}}</ref> In this case, the court sided with the IRS's view that considers each tax year separately. Here, ''FleetBoston Fin. Corp.'', in its 1984 tax filing, estimated that it had overpaid its taxes, and used a credit elect to move this overpayment to 1985, then in 1985 it again estimated an overpayment and used a credit elect to move the overpayment to 1986. IRS subsequently audited the company and ultimately determined that it had underpaid taxes for 1984 and 1985. The dispute was about whether the money that ''FleetBoston'' had initially paid for 1984 and then moved to later years through the credit elect was money that the IRS had "use" of. The IRS argued that once the money was moved to a subsequent year via a credit elect, the IRS no longer had use of the money for the original year (1984) and therefore should be able to charge interest for it. The court sided with the IRS's interpretation.
* ''Otis Spunkmeyer v. United States'' (2004):<ref name=caselaw-fleetboston/> In this case, the court sided with the taxpayer. Specifically, the court ruled that if a taxpayer used a credit elect to move money but the year the money was being moved to already had sufficient funds, the credit elect was not needed and the IRS could be considered to still have "use" of that money for the original year.
* ''Goldring v. United States'' (2021):<ref name=thetaxadviser/> In this case, the district court sided with the IRS, but the Fifth Circuit court sided with the taxpayer. In this case, the Goldrings made a $5 million overpayment on their 2010 taxes as a safeguard against the IRS interpreting their income differently than the way the Goldrings classified it on their tax return. They then kept moving that overpayment to subsequent years using a credit elect transfer. Eventually, the IRS did end up choosing the interpretation that the Goldrings had thought it might, but it also ended up charging the Goldrings interest, claiming that the $5 million was not in the account for 2010. The district court sided with the IRS, but the Fifth Circuit court sided with the taxpayer, claiming that the IRS had use of the money all along even if it was not within the correct year.

In the ordinary tax return process, there is no provision for taxpayers to pay additional amounts of tax ''and keep them in the original tax year'' after filing a return, as a safeguard against interest if the IRS later determines that the tax was underpaid. However, starting in 2004, the IRS provided taxpayers the option to make "deposits" tied to a specific tax year, that taxpayers can use to cover disputable taxes.<ref name=thetaxadviser/>
