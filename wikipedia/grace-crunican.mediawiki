Crunican announced her resignation abruptly in January 2001. Her salary at the time of resignation was $118,000. Crunican's resignation came on the heels of two other state agency director resignations, but a spokesman for Governor [[John Kitzhaber]] said that the spate of resignations was coincidental and not part of a purge.<ref name=crunican-resigns-from-odot>{{Cite web|url = http://djcoregon.com/news/2001/01/19/odot-director-issues-surprise-resignation-announcement/|title = ODOT director issues surprise resignation announcement|date = January 19, 2001|accessdate = July 22, 2017|publisher = DJC Oregon}}</ref><ref name=democratherald>{{cite web|url = http://democratherald.com/odot-director-crunican-resigns/article_c0bd671d-4355-56ff-9e1c-f2e6851ecc88.html|title = ODOT director Crunican resigns|publisher = Albany Democrat-Herald|date = January 18, 2001|accessdate = July 22, 2017}}</ref> Crunican's work was praised by Aloha Republican Representative [[Bruce Starr]], who expressed surprise at her resignation, as well as by [[Gary George]], the Senate Transportation Committee chairman who had previously been critical of ODOT.<ref name=crunican-resigns-from-odot/><ref name=democratherald/> Her resignation was effective February 28, 2001.<ref name=odot-audit-report>{{cite web|url = http://sos.oregon.gov/Documents/audits/full/2001/2001-42.pdf|title = Secretary of State Audit Report Oregon Department of Transportation|date = October 12, 2001|accessdate = July 22, 2017|publisher = Oregon Secretary of State}}</ref>

=== Seattle Department of Transportation (2002–2009)===

Crunican began serving as the Director of the [[Seattle Department of Transportation]] in 2002 (known at the time as the Seattle Transportation Department), becoming the second person to serve in that role. The Seattle Department of Transportation had been created in 1997, and Crunican replaced outgoing director Daryl Grigsby.<ref name=seattle-city-archives>{{cite web|url = https://www.seattle.gov/cityarchives/seattle-facts/city-officials#directordepartmentoftransportation|title = Director, Department of Transportation, Seattle Municipal Archives|accessdate = July 22, 2017}}</ref> While there, Crunican implemented Bridging the Gap (a transportation maintenance levy)<ref name=seattle-times-crunican-resigns>{{cite web|url = http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/seattle-transportation-director-crunican-resigns/|title = Seattle transportation director Crunican resigns|date = December 28, 2009|accessdate = July 22, 2017|publisher = ''[[Seattle Times]]''}}</ref><ref name=spur-board-bio/><ref name=bart-gm/> and the Transit Master Plan (Seattle Connections, Bike Master Plan, Freight Mobility Strategic Plan, and Pedestrian Master Plan), the latter with the goal of helping Seattle achieve the U.S. [[Kyoto Protocol]] goals.<ref name=spur-board-bio/><ref name=bart-gm/>

In 2008, due to a series of heavy snowstorms, Seattle's transportation was paralyzed for a few days, and Crunican's inadequate response to the snowstorm was criticized.<ref name=seattle-times-crunican-resigns/><ref name=case-for-grace>{{cite web|url = https://www.seattlemet.com/articles/2009/12/3/the-case-for-grace|title = The Case for Grace|last = Barnett|first = Erica|date = December 3, 2009|accessdate = July 22, 2017}}</ref><ref name=crunican-alameda-magazine-profile/> Among other things, her decision to use sand instead of salt to clear out the accumulated snow (to limit environmental damage to the Bay) was implicated as a reason for the snow not being cleared out quickly enough.<ref name=crunican-alameda-magazine-profile/> Crunican was also criticized for going on vacation while the snow had not cleared out, and for failing to take responsibility and lacking a customer service mindset.<ref name=seattle-times-crunican-good-riddance>{{cite web|url = http://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/seattle-transportation-chiefs-departure-was-expected/|title = Seattle transportation chief’s departure was expected|date = December 29, 2009|accessdate = July 22, 2017|publisher = ''[[Seattle Times]]''}}</ref>

Despite considerable dissatisfaction at Crunican, Mayor [[Greg Nickels]] refused to fire her, citing her overall positive track record including her work on Bridging the Gap,<ref name=seattle-times-crunican-good-riddance/> a sentiment echoed by other Crunican supporters.<ref name=case-for-grace/> However, shortly after the mayor's job was turned over to [[Mike McGinn]], Crunican announced on December 28, 2009 that she was resigning and would start her own consulting company.<ref name=seattle-times-crunican-resigns/><ref name=crunican-alameda-magazine-profile/><ref name=seattle-times-crunican-good-riddance/><ref>{{cite web|url = http://westseattleblog.com/2009/12/sdot-announces-grace-crunican-is-resigning/|title = Updates: SDOT announces director Grace Crunican is resigning|date = December 28, 2009|accessdate = July 22, 2017|publisher = West Seattle Blog}}</ref>
