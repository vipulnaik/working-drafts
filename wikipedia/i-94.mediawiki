'''Form I-94''', the '''Arrival-Departure Record Card''', is a form used by [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP) intended to keep track of the arrival and departure to/from the United States of people who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents (with the exception of those who are entering using the [[Visa Waiver Program]] or [[Compact of Free Association]], using [[Border Crossing Card]]s, re-entering via [[automatic visa revalidation]], or entering temporarily as crew members).<ref name=air-and-sea-arrivals/> Secondarily, it is used to determine the status and expiration date of the person's stay in the United States.<ref name=immihelp/> While the form is usually issued by CBP at [[port of entry|ports of entry]] or [[deferred inspection]] sites, USCIS can issue an equivalent as part of the Form I-797A approval notice for a [[Form I-129]] petition for an alien worker or a [[Form I-539]] application for extension of stay or change of status (in the case that the alien is already in the United States).<ref name=i797a-approval>{{cite web|url = http://www.h1bwiki.com/i-797a-i797b-i797c/|title = H-1B: Form I-797 Types â€“ A, B and C|publisher = H1B Wiki|date = August 21, 2012|accessdate = July 8, 2016}}</ref><ref name=i-539-facts/>

== Issuance for arriving aliens ==

The responsibility of issuing Form I-94 is with the [[CBP Office of Field Operations]] (OFO), a subdivision of [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP), that processes entries and exits at [[port of entry|ports of entry]] (land, sea, and air) as well as [[deferred inspection]] sites. Note that OFO is distinct from the [[United States Border Patrol]], whose responsibility is to patrol the rest of the border to monitor for unauthorized border-crossing.

=== At a port of entry ===

The most common place of issue of Form I-94 is at ports of entry, including airports, sea ports, and land ports. The form is issued electronically at airports and sea ports but can be issued both electronically and as a paper form at land ports.<ref name=air-and-sea-arrivals/><ref name=nolo-bcc>{{cite web|url = http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/how-obtain-use-border-crossing-card.html|title = How to Obtain and Use a Border Crossing Card.

For air and sea travel, the process begins even before the alien has departed for the United States: the alien's air and sea carrier collect information about the alien (such as passport number) and send this information to CBP.<ref name=air-and-sea-arrivals>{{cite web|url = https://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/i-94-instructions/i94-rollout|title = Arrival/Departure Record Process Changes for Foreign Visitors Arriving via Air or Sea|date = December 20, 2013|accessdate = December 29, 2016|publisher = [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]]}}</ref> 

At the port of entry, the arriving alien is screened by an officer from the CBP [[Office of Field Operations]]. If the CBP officer is convinced, based on the alien's documentation and all other evidence submitted, that the alien can be admitted into the United States, the officer issues a Form I-94 to the alien.<ref name=air-and-sea-arrivals/> The form specifies the status in which the alien is admitted (this should be consistent with the alien's visa) and the expiration date of the alien's stay in that status (for some statuses, the expiration date is entered as "D/S" indicating that the alien can stay as long as the underlying status is valid).<ref name=immihelp>{{cite web|url = http://www.immihelp.com/visas/visa-stamp-arrival-departure-record.html|title = Difference between visa stamp and arrival departure record|publisher = ImmiHelp|accessdate = December 29, 2016}}</ref> 

At air and sea ports, the form is issued electronically and the officer also stamps the alien's passport. The I-94 can be retrieved at any time using an online retrieval tool.<ref name=history-now-available>{{cite web|url = https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/spotlights/arrivaldeparture-history-now-available-i-94-webpage|title = Arrival/Departure History Now Available on I-94 Webpage|date = April 30, 2014|accessdate = December 29, 2016|publisher = [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/recent-search|title = Get Most Recent I-94|publisher = [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]]|accessdate = December 29, 2016}}</ref> At land ports, only paper forms are issued for people who have not informed the CBP of their arrival in advance.<ref name=nolo-bcc/> However, in September 2016, CBP announced that land travelers who inform the CBP in advance and pay a $6 fee can get electronic Form I-94s issued at land ports of entry.<ref name=lexology-land>{{cite web|url = http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=ab84d9ff-c8fd-4d34-887d-8ab5329d077d|title = Online I-94 Application Now Available for Travelers at Land Ports of Entry|last = Hermansky|first = Jennifer|date = October 12, 2016|accessdate = December 29, 2016|publisher = Lexology}}</ref><ref name=ifallsjournal-land>{{cite web|url = http://www.ifallsjournal.com/news/public_safety/cbp-makes-online-i--application-payment-available-to-travelers/article_ab2d7ebd-af33-5dc9-be98-3f0460dad5f4.html|title = CBP makes online I-94 application, payment available to travelers|date = September 30, 2016|accessdate = December 29, 2016}}</ref>

=== At a deferred inspection site ===

In some cases, the officer at the port of entry may not be able to make a decision as to whether to admit the alien. This could be due to missing documentation, need for further review of the case, need for a maintenance of status and departure bond, or other similar reasons. In this case, the port of entry can issue the alien a Form I-546, asking the alien to complete the process at a [[deferred inspection]] site, as well as a temporary Form I-94, with expiration date at most 30 days in the future. The process of admission of the alien and issuance of a long-term Form I-94 is then completed at the deferred inspection site.<ref name=ifm>{{cite web|url = http://foiarr.cbp.gov/streamingWord.asp?j=237|title = Inspector's Field Manual, Chapter 17.

Deferred inspection sites can also be used to correct errors in Form I-94s issued at ports of entry.<ref name=nafsa-di>{{Cite web|url = http://www.nafsa.org/uploadedFiles/Chez_NAFSA/Find_Resources/Supporting_International_Students_And_Scholars/Committee_Updates/ISSRP/cbp_cal_51214.pdf|title = Questions and Discussion Topics.

=== Exceptional cases where a Form I-94 is not issued ===

Form I-94 is only issued to people who are not United States citizens or permanent residents. Among these, it is not issued in the following cases:

* For people from [[Mexico]] with [[Border Crossing Card]]s, if they are entering by land and plan to travel only a few miles into the United States for a short period of time. In case of longer durations of stay or travel deeper into the United States, the alien should obtain a Form I-94 at the (land) port of entry.<ref name=nolo-bcc/>
* For people entering via the [[Visa Waiver Program]] (VWP). Historically, the CBP recorded arrival and departures under the VWP using Form I-94W.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.cbp.gov/document/forms/form-i-94w-visa-waiver-arrivaldeparture-record|title = Form I-94W - Visa Waiver Arrival/Departure Record|date = January 13, 2014|accessdate = December 29, 2016|publisher = [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]]}}</ref> However, the I-94W is no longer used. It has been deprecated since 2010, and all VWP travelers need to obtain an [[Electronic System for Travel Authorization]] (ESTA) prior to traveling to the United States.<ref name="esta">{{cite press release|url=http://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/pr_1231771555521.shtm|title=DHS Reminds Visa Waiver Program Travelers of ESTA Requirements Effective Today|publisher=[[Department of Homeland Security]]|date=2009-01-12|accessdate=2010-09-27}}</ref> <ref name="dropped">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/id_visa/i-94_instructions/automated_processing.xml|title=Automated Processing for VWP Applicants}}</ref>
* For people entering the United States from one of the countries in the [[Compact of Free Association]]. These people are issued a Form I-94A.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/what-is-the-difference-between-i-94-and-i-94a--484916.html|title = What is the difference between I-94 and I-94A?|publisher = [[Avvo]]|accessdate = December 29, 2016}}</ref>
* For people re-entering the United States using [[automatic visa revalidation]]. In this case, the new entry is considered to have occurred using the I-94 issued at the previous entry, and a new Form I-94 is not issued.<ref name=state-avr>{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/general/automatic-revalidation.html|title = Automatic Revalidation|publisher = [[United States Department of State]], [[Bureau of Consular Affairs]]|accessdate = April 4, 2015}}</ref><ref name=cbp-avr>{{cite web|url=https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/1218/~/automatic-revalidation-for-certain-temporary-visitors|title = Automatic revalidation for certain temporary visitors|accessdate = April 4, 2015|publisher = United States [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs and Border Protection]]}}</ref>
* For crew members of air and sea vessels landing in the United States. These people are issued a Form I-95 instead.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/1665/~/i-95-period-of-validity|title = I-95 Period of Validity|publisher = [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]]|accessdate = December 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.cbp.gov/document/forms/form-i-95-crewmans-landing-permit|title = Form I-95 - Crewman's Landing Permit|date = January 13, 2014|accessdate = December 29, 2016}}</ref>

=== USCIS Form I-94 ===

In case of an extension of stay or change of nonimmigrant status within the United States, the USCIS can issue its equivalent of Form I-94 as part of the I-797A approval notice. This applies to two main types of forms:<ref name=i797a-approval/>

* [[Form I-129]], Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, which can be used by a person already in the United States with authorization to change status to a temporary worker status. Note that Form I-129 can also be used by people currently outside the United States, but in that case, a Form I-797B approval notice is issued instead, and this does not include a Form I-94. Rather, in this case, the approval notice is used to obtain a temporary work visa, that the alien then uses to enter the United States and get a Form I-94 from CBP at the port of entry.<ref name=i797a-approval/>
* [[Form I-539]], Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, which is used to change nonimmigrant status or extend one's stay on an existing status (beyond the expiration date of the Form I-94). An approval of Form I-539 is always accompanied by the USCIS issuing a new Form I-94.<ref name=i-539-facts>{{cite web|url=https://immigrationlawnj.com/10-mind-boggling-facts-non-immigrant-visa-denials/|title=Non Immigrant Visa Denials: 10 Mind Boggling Facts!|publisher=Harlan York|accessdate=2015-08-05}}</ref>

Note that for students on an [[F visa]], the I-94's expiration date is listed as "D/S", for duration of status. Thus, stay is extended by having the student's SEVIS record updated and a new [[I-20 (form)|I-20]] issued, without a new Form I-94 being issused.<ref name=uscis-guidance-2>{{cite web|url = http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Resources/C2en.pdf|title = I am a nonimmigrant.

=== Automation at sea and air ports in 2013 ===

The switch away from paper Form I-94 to electronic Form I-94 was carried out in 2013. The change to I-94 definition to allow for the electronic format was recorded in the ''[[Federal Register]]'' on March 27, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/03/27/2013-06974/definition-of-form-i-94-to-include-electronic-format|title = Definition of Form I-94 To Include Electronic Format|date = March 27, 2013|accessdate = December 29, 2016|publisher = ''[[Federal Register]]''}}</ref>
