The '''U visa''' is a nonimmigrant [[Visa (document)|visa]] which is set aside for victims of [[Crime in the United States|crimes]] (and their immediate family members) who have suffered substantial mental or physical abuse and are willing to assist law enforcement and government officials in the investigation or prosecution of the criminal activity.

==Background==
[[United States Congress|Congress]] created the U nonimmigrant visa with the passage of the [[Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act]] (including the Battered Immigrant Womenâ€™s Protection Act) in October 2000. The legislation was intended to strengthen the ability of law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute cases of domestic violence, sexual assault, trafficking of aliens and other crimes while, at the same time, offer protection to victims of such crimes. The legislation also helps law enforcement agencies to better serve victims of crimes.

==Eligibility==

* The applicant must have been helpful, is being helpful, or is likely to be helpful in the investigation or prosecution of the crime.
* The criminal activity occurred in the United States or violated U.S. laws.
* The applicant is admissible to the United States under current U.S. immigration laws and regulations. Those who are not admissible, may apply for a waiver on a [http://www.uscis.gov/i-192 Form I-192, Application for Advance Permission to Enter as a Non-Immigrant].

===Certification of helpfulness===
A petition for U nonimmigrant status must also contain a ''certification of helpfulness'' in the form of a U Nonimmigrant Status Certification (Form I-918, Supplement B) from a certifying law enforcement agency.  This document demonstrates the petitioner "has been helpful, is being helpful, or is likely to be helpful" in the investigation or prosecution of the criminal activity.

The government entities which are considered "certifying agencies" for the purpose of a U visa application include [[Law enforcement in the United States|Federal, State or local law enforcement agencies]], [[prosecutor]]s, and [[judge]]s, as well as [[child protective services]], the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], and the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]].

* A self-affidavit by the applicant himself or herself attesting to three years of continuous physical presence in the United States since being admitted as a U nonimmigrant and listing the dates of any departures from and arrivals to the United States while in U status;<ref>8 CFR Section 245.24(a)</ref>

== Statistics ==

=== Number of visas issued by year ===

Although the U status was created in October 2000, the first visas based on this status were issued in Fiscal Year 2009. In the table below, the years are Fiscal Years, so for instance the year 2009 refers to the period from October 1, 2008 to September 30, 2009.<ref name=visa-approvals>{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/Non-Immigrant-Statistics/NIVDetailTables/FYs97-15_NIVDetailTable.xls |title=Non-immigrant visa statistics |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |accessdate=January 29, 2017}}</ref> Note that this only counts U visas issued at embassies and consulates outside the United States, and does not include people who changed nonimmigrant status to U status within the United States (through [[Form I-539]]).
