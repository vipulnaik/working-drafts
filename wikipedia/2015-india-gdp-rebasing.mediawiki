In 2015, the [[government of India]] made a number of changes to the way it calculated GDP, including a change in the base year relative to which calculations are done. This change was known as the '''2015 India GDP rebasing''' or just the '''rebasing'''.<ref name=wsj>{{cite web|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/india-changes-gdp-calculation-method-1422622762|title = India Changes GDP Calculation Method.

== Changes made ==

There were two main changes made by the [[Central Statistics Office (India)|Central Statistics Office]] to bring Indian GDP calculations more in line with international standards as enshrined in the [[System of National Accounts]]: change of the base year to 2011/12, and switch to market prices.

=== Change of base year ===

Since January 2010, the base year used by statisticians in India's [[Central Statistics Office (India)|Central Statistics Office]] was the 12 months ending March 2005 (i.e., the 2004/05 year). The rebasing changed the base year for calculations to the year ending March 2012 (i.e., the 2011/12 year).<ref name=wsj/><ref name=worstall-sensible/><ref name=seekingalpha/> The more recent base year helped because it incorporated a more up-to-date picture of the economy/market structure (???)

=== Change to using market prices ===

The change also switched GDP calculation to using market prices rather than factor costs. to take into account gross value addition in goods and services as well as indirect taxes.<ref name=reuters>{{cite web|url = http://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-gdp/methodology-change-sees-indian-economy-grow-faster-than-chinas-idINKBN0LD1AI20150209|title = Methodology change sees Indian economy grow faster than China's|last = Singh|first = Rajesh Kumar|last2 = Kumar|first2 = Manoj|date = February 9, 2015|accessdate = November 15, 2017|publisher = [[Reuters]]}}</ref> The change was claimed by the government to be more in line with global practices; commentators agreed that this practice was more in line with the recommendations of the [[System of National Accounts]].<ref name=worstall-sensible/> Specifically, the previous system of using factor costs was believed to be a relic of the Nehruvian Fabian socialist era.<ref name=worstall-sensible/>

=== Incorporation of more and better survey data ===
