This is a timeline of [[Amazon Web Services]], which offers a suite of cloud computing services that make up an on-demand computing platform.

! Time period !! class="unsortable" | Key developments at Amazon Web Services
|-
| 2003–2005 || Amazon Web Services is in the planning and private beta phase. The blog is launched and EC2 is made available to select customers privately.
|-
| 2006–2007 || AWS releases its first product in the categories of storage (Amazon S3), compute (Amazon EC2), database (Amazon SimpleDB), and data flow (Amazon Simple Queue Service). The service remains in beta, in only one region, without the concept of availability zones.
|-
| 2008–2010 || AWS exits beta and offers a Service Level Agreement (SLA). It launches many new products to help with more logical and controlled infrastructure management as well as more redundancy and high availability. It introduces the concept of availability zones and elastic IPs, facilitating redundancy and availability, and launches new AWS regions. It also introduces core AWS features such as autoscaling, elastic load balancing, CloudWatch, CloudFront, Elastic Block Store, CloudFormation, Simple Notification Service, and Route 53. In this period, companies such as [[Reddit]], [[Zynga]], and [[Netflix]] announce the intent to migrate to AWS, and a new generation of companies built on AWS from day one, including [[Pinterest]] and [[Airbnb]], get started.
|-
| 2011–2013 || AWS continues expanding to more regions and adding to its product offerings in storage, compute, database, and other areas. Migration of existing companies to AWS and the building of new companies on AWS also continues. One emerging trend over this period is a growth of the AWS ecosystem, with tools like Netflix's Simian Army, and entire companies such as Cloudyn that help with understanding and navigating AWS. Competition from Microsoft and IBM also picks up, and Zynga announces its decision to move off AWS. High-profile AWS outages cause downtime for widely used websites that rely on AWS. 
|-
| 2014–2016 || AWS continues to grow and add new services and regions. It expands its focus to new areas, such as machine learning tools, Internet of Things, and providing physical infrastructure (Such as Snowball and Snowmobile) to facilitate large-scale data migration to the cloud. It launches [[AWS Lambda]] and the EC2 Container Service, exploiting and helping further the trends of serverless architecture and containerization respectively. The regional expansions are couched more in terms of helping customers in different parts of the world achieve low latency and meet data privacy requirements to facilitate adoption. AWS loses [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]] but gains [[Salesforce.com]] and [[VMware]] as partners.

|-
| 2000 || || Prelude || [[Amazon.com]], the parent company of the as yet nonexistent AWS, begins work on merchant.com, an e-commerce platform intended for use by other large retailers such as [[Target Corporation]]. In the process, Amazon's team realizes that they need to decouple their code better, with cleaner interfaces and access APIs. Around the same time, the company also realizes the need to build infrastructure-as-a-service internally, to improve the speed of development and not have it bottlenecked by infrastructure availability. All these changes help pave the way for AWS.<ref>{{cite web|url =https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/|title = How AWS came to be|date = July 2, 2016|accessdate = December 4, 2016|publisher = ''[[TechCrunch]]''|last = Miller|first = Ron}}</ref><ref name=medium-jassy>{{cite web|url = https://medium.com/@furrier/original-content-the-story-of-aws-and-andy-jassys-trillion-dollar-baby-4e8a35fd7ed#.g4p7t635j|title = Exclusive: The Story of AWS and Andy Jassy’s Trillion Dollar Baby.
