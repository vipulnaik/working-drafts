=== Memo controversy ===

On June 18, 2016, Bosworth wrote a memo circulated internally within Facebook, titled "The Ugly", arguing that connecting people was a paramount goal for Facebook, and justified many of the company's practices. The memo also acknowledged that this could have negative consequences, for instance, be used by terrorist attacks coordinated via Facebook. The publication date of the memo was a day after the shooting death of a Chicago man was recorded via [[Facebook Live]]. The memo generated strong, polarized reactions within the company. The memo was leaked to and reported on by ''[[BuzzFeed]]'' on March 29, 2018.<ref name=buzzfeed-memo>{{cite web|url= https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/growth-at-any-cost-top-facebook-executive-defended-data|title = Top Facebook Executive Defended Data Collection In 2016 Memo — And Warned That Facebook Could Get People Killed.

In a statement given to ''BuzzFeed'' after publication of the story, Facebook CEO and principal founder [[Mark Zuckerberg]] said: "Boz is a talented leader who says many provocative things. This was one that most people at Facebook including myself disagreed with strongly. We've never believed the ends justify the means. We recognize that connecting people isn't enough by itself. We also need to work to bring people closer together. We changed our whole mission and company focus to reflect this last year."<ref name=buzzfeed-memo/><ref name=wapo-memo/>

Responding to the publication of the memo by ''BuzzFeed'', Bosworth wrote: "I don't agree with the post today and I didn't agree with it even when I wrote it. The purpose of this post, like many others I have written internally, was to bring to the surface issues I felt deserved more discussion with the broader company."<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://mashable.com/2018/03/29/facebook-andrew-bosworth-memo/|title = Facebook VP Andrew Bosworth frantically takes to Twitter following leaked memo|last = Morse|first = Jack|date = March 29, 2018|accessdate = October 20, 2018|publisher = Mashable}}</ref>
