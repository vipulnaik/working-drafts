== History ==

=== Launch and initial years of WHO-CHOICE ===

In May 1998, [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] succeeded [[Hiroshi Nakajima]] as the Director-General of the [[World Health Organization]], and the organization was significantly restructuring as a result of the leadership change. With her election, a new program, called '''Choosing Interventions: Effectiveness Quality,Costs, Gender and Ethics''', was launched as part of the Global Programme for Evidence on Health and Policy. The name of the program would later morph into WHO-CHOICE.<ref name=murray-2000/>

WHO-CHOICE refined its methodology quite a bit in the first few years ... (2003 guide publication, 2012 BMJ publications).

== Tools and methods ==

=== Adoption of sectoral CEA ===

Prior to WHO-CHOICE, most projects that did cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) in the real world focused on evaluating a single program or intervention, comparing it against either a fixed price threshold or an existing array of interventions with predetermined cost-effectiveness taken from the literature. However, theoretical literature on CEAs considered a broader kind of CEA called "sectoral CEA" where all programs and interventions available within a sector would be compared and cost-effectiveness priorities would be determined. Prior to WHO-CHOICE, there were only a few examples of practical implementation of sectoral CEAs: the [[Oregon Health Services Commission]] (tasked with prioritizing for [[Medicaid]] in the [[United States]]), the [[World Bank Health Sectors Priorities Review]], and the [[Harvard Life Saving Project]]. Of these, only the World Bank's work had attempted a global comparison.<ref name=murray-2000/><ref name=hutubessy-2003/> In a 2000 paper discussing the WHO-CHOICE approach, Murray et al. identified four challenges to a wider application of sectoral CEA:

# Resource allocation decisions affecting the entire health sector must also take into account social concerns, such as priority for the sick, reducing social inequalities in health, or the well-being of future generations. The history of the Oregon Health Services Commission provides an example of the sort of conflicts that emerge as a result of balancing all these concerns.
# Current CEA is too focused on the evaluation of new strategies, rather than identifying potential for efficiency improvements by reallocating within existing strategies.
# For all but the richest societies, the cost and time required to evaluate the large set of interventions required may be prohibitive.
# It is difficult to institutionalize CEA, and a number of conflicting CEA guidelines at national and regional levels have proliferated.

=== Use of generalized CEA (a type of sectoral CEA) based on epidemiological subregions ===

WHO-CHOICE identified a key trade-off in sectoral CEA based on the granularity of the region at which the CEA was performed. At one extreme, sectoral CEA could be performed at the level of individual cities or districts, incorporating information about local resources, costs, and current context. At the other extreme, a single CEA could be carried out globally. Highly localized sectoral CEA would be very expensive and difficult to perform whereas global CEA would fail to take into account the huge differences between the epidemiology and resource structure of regions.<ref name=gwwc-overview/><ref name=murray-2000/><ref name=guide-2003/>

WHO-CHOICE's solution was to use an intermediate level of granularity, that it called "generalized CEA" (GCEA). It argued that at this intermediate level, it could conduct CEAs more efficiently while also allowing local policymakers and agents to use its findings and further adapt them to local contexts.<ref name=murray-2000/><ref name=gwwc-overview/> 

WHO-CHOICE has divided the world into 14 epidemiological subregions, and publishes its findings by subregion, as shown below. Each subregion is a combination of a region (a geographical region of the world) and a mortality stratum (a stratum describing the level and nature of mortality). WHO-CHOICE chose to put each country in a single mortality stratum and a single region (and therefore a single subregion) even if mortality varies widely within the country.<ref name=gwwc-overview/><ref name=hutubessy-2003/>

* There are 6 regions: AFR (Africa), AMR (Americas), EMR (Middle East), EUR (Europe), SEAR (South-East Asia), and WPR (West Pacific). 
* There are 5 mortality strata, defined as follows:
** A = very low rates of adult and child mortality
** B = low adult mortality, low child mortality
** C = high adult mortality, low child mortality
** D = high adult mortality, high child mortality
** E = very high adult mortality, high child mortality

Although the 6 regions and 5 mortality strata could give a theoretical maximum of 6 X 5 = 30 subregions, only 14 subregions occur in practice because not every region has countries with all mortality strata.

Below is the classification into subregions as of 2003.<ref name=hutubessy-2003/>

=== Modifications to ICM-CEA to use null set as comparator for interventions ===

The CEA done by WHO-CHOICE differed from the standard ICM-CEA in two important ways:<ref name=murray-2000/><ref name=guide-2003/><ref name=gwwc-overview/>

# Interventions were compared against the null set of interventions, rather than the existing backdrop of interventions. This provides a complete cost-effectiveness analysis that can be adapted more easily to different subregions and different times.
# Results are presented in a single league table. For each set of mutually exclusive interventions (between which a selection is being made), the intervention with the lowest average cost-effectiveness with respect to the null set is presented first. If there are two or more rows, the second intervention is the one with the lowest slope with respect to the internvention with the lowest CE, and so on. Essentially, this identifies the [[principal component analysis|principal component]]s for the best intervention.

=== Intended usage ===

The results that WHO-CHOICE reports are not intended to be applied literally when choosing policies or selecting interventions. This is for a few reasons:<ref name=hutubessy-2003/>

* The interventions available in a specific local context, as well as the cost and effectiveness estimates, may vary between contexts. Some interventions covered by WHO-CHOICE may not exist in the local context, and other interventions available in the local context may not be covered by WHO-CHOICE.
* The model does not fully capture all the real-world interactions and phenomena. For instance, transition costs are not modeled separately.
* The ranking of interventions by cost-effectiveness could be fairly non-robust, with huge margins of error making the ranking uncertain.

Rather, the results are intended to be used as a starting point in classifying interventions as highly cost-effective, moderately cost-effective, and cost-ineffective. With this classification in place, a more detailed and localized analysis can be done for the highly cost-effective interventions, incorporating concerns such as poverty, equity, implementation capacity, and feasibility.<ref name=hutubessy-2003/>

=== Tools used for the estimates ===

WHO-CHOICE lists the following tools that it uses and can provide to researchers interested in using WHO-CHOICE:<ref name=cea-tools>{{cite web|url = http://www.who.int/choice/cost-effectiveness/tools/en/|title = Cost effectiveness and strategic planning (WHO-CHOICE)|publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|accessdate = January 4, 2017}}</ref>

* PopMod simulates the time evolution of an arbitrary population subject to births, deaths, and two distinct disease conditions. It has yearly granularity and keeps track of population by age and sex.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.who.int/choice/cost-effectiveness/tools/popmod/en/|title = PopMod|publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|accessdate = January 4, 2017}}</ref> A research paper describing PopMod called it the first multi-state dynamic [[life table]], and highlighted how it modeled multiple diseases with interaction terms.<ref>{{cite journal|title = PopMod: a longitudinal population model with two interacting disease states|last = Lauer|first = Jeremy|last2 = Röhrich|first2 = Klaus|last3 = Wirth|first3 = Harald|last4 = Charette|first4 = Claude|last5 = Gribble|first5 = Steve|last6 = Murray|first6 = Christopher J.L.|journal = Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation|doi = 10.1186/1478-7547-1-6|date = February 26, 2003|accessdate = January 4, 2017}}</ref>
* CEA country contextualization templates: These templates help contextualize WHO-CHOICE's results (that are provided at the level of epidemiological subregion) to specific countries based on estimated information about population and costs in the country, that is pre-populated into the tool.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.who.int/choice/cost-effectiveness/tools/CEA_context/en/|title = CEA country contextualization templates|publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|accessdate = January 4, 2017}}</ref>
* CostIt (Costing Intervention Templates) is a software for the recording and analysis of cost data. It is not a data-collection tool but can guide the development of instruments for collecting data. Its main value add is in automating the computation of the [[economic cost]]s of intervention, though it can also be used to compute financial costs.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.who.int/choice/toolkit/cost_it/en/|title = CostIt, under Cost effectiveness and strategic planning (WHO-CHOICE)|publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|accessdate = January 20, 2017}}</ref> One feature of CostIt is that it automatically adjusts for capacity utilization, and therefore, comes to different conclusions based on different levels of capacity utilization: for instance, it would come to different conclusions if the hospital bed occupancy rate were 30% than if it were 80%.
* MCLeague (Monte Carlo League) is a software program that represents uncertainty around costs and effects to decision-makers in the form of stochastic league tables. It provides information on the probability that any given intervention is in the optimal intervention mix for a given level of resource availability. The program also allows for covariance between costs and outcomes.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.who.int/choice/toolkit/mc_league/en/|title = MC League, under Cost effectiveness and strategic planning (WHO-CHOICE) |publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|accessdate = January 20, 2017}}</ref><ref name=guide-2003/>
