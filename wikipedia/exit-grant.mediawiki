An '''exit grant''' is a grant made (typically by a private foundation or other large donor to a nonprofit) with the clear expectation that the donor will not make any further similar grants to the donee.<ref name=grantcraft>{{cite web|url = http://www.grantcraft.org/guides/the-effective-exit|title = The Effective Exit: Managing the End of a Funding Relationship|last = Jaffe|first = Jan|last2 = MacKinnon|first2 = Anne|publisher = [[Foundation Center]]|accessdate = December 12, 2017}}</ref><ref name=wisephilanthropy>{{cite web|url = http://wisephilanthropy.com/exit-strategies-why-when-how/1469|title = Exit Strategies: Why, When, How|last = Marker|first = Richard|date = January 27, 2016|accessdate = December 12, 2017}}</ref><ref name=ssir>{{cite web|url = https://ssir.org/articles/entry/making_a_graceful_exit|title = Making a Graceful Exit.

== Reasons for exit grant ==

Typical reasons for exit grants include:

* The donor is winding down its activities, for instance, by exhausting its fund. Examples include [[Atlantic Philanthropies]] and the Belton Fund.<ref name=ssir/><ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.google.com/search?q=%22exit+grant%22+site%3Aatlanticphilanthropies.org|title = Search results for "exit grant" on Atlantic Philanthropies website|accessdate = December 12, 2017}}</ref>
* The donor is stopping or reducing spending on the specific program or initiative within which the grant is made. An example is the winding down of the [[Nonprofit Marketplace Initiative]] by the Hewlett Foundation.<ref name=nmi-givewell-exit>{{cite web|url = https://blog.givewell.org/2014/08/05/thoughts-on-the-end-of-hewletts-nonprofit-marketplace-initiative/|title = Thoughts on the end of Hewlett’s Nonprofit Marketplace Initiative|date = August 5, 2014|accessdate = December 12, 2017|publisher = GiveWell|last = Karnofsky|first = Holden}}</ref> It could also be that the donor is reducing resources for grants and evaluation in the program, even if the program is not being completely shut down.<ref name=open-phil-for-exit>{{cite web|url = https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/scientific-research/miscellaneous/future-research-exit-grant-2017|title = Future of Research — Exit Grant|accessdate = December 12, 2017|publisher = Open Philanthropy Project}}</ref>
* Recent evidence (or lack of evidence) has led the donor to decide against the value of ongoing support to the grantee.<ref name=open-phil-ptp-grant>{{cite web|url = https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/immigration-policy/october-2017-update-protect-people-seasonal-migration-haiti|title = October 2017 Update on Protect the People Grant|accessdate = December 12, 2017|publisher = Open Philanthropy Project}}</ref><ref name=givewell-new-incentives-exit>{{cite web|url = https://www.givewell.org/charities/new-incentives/november-2016-grant|title = New Incentives — Exit Grant and Immunizations Pilot|accessdate = December 12, 2017|publisher = GiveWell}}</ref>

The generally offered reason for making exit grants rather than abruptly stopping support is that they give grantees sufficient time to find alternative sources or make other plans to deal with the financial and reputational costs of losing a major funding source.<ref name=ssir/><ref name=givewell-new-incentives-exit/> Advice for philanthropists focuses on helping grantees develop organizational capacity as part of the exit strategy.<ref name=ssir/><ref name=grantcraft/>
