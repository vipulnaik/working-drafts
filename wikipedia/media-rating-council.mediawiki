The '''Media Rating Council''' ('''MRC''') is a United States-based nonprofit organization that manages accreditation for media research and rating purposes.<ref name=wsj-most-powerful>{{cite web|url = https://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/03/05/the-most-powerful-player-in-media-youve-never-heard-of/|title = The Most Powerful Player in Media You’ve Never Heard Of|last = Shields|first = Mike|date = March 5, 2015|publisher = ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://adage.com/article/digital/mrc-100-standard-digital-ads/309891/|title=Ad Industry Group May Consider Tougher 100% Standard for Digital Ad Viewability|date = July 24, 2017|publisher=AdverisingAge|language=en|last = Neff|first = Jack}}</ref>

== Structure and accreditation process ==

The MRC has five full-time employees, and 150 member organizations. It performs accreditations for rating and research companies like [[Nielsen Corporation|Nielsen]], [[comScore]], and Arbitron. It is funded by member dues, which run in the thousands of dollars.<ref name=wsj-most-powerful/>

The MRC does not conduct the audit of the companies being accredited itself. The audits are done by accounting firms such as [[Ernst & Young]]. The company being accredited pays for the audit, with fees that could be in the hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. Each time a company that was previously audited changes its methodology, it needs to be audited again to continue to qualify for MRC accreditation.<ref name=wsj-most-powerful/>

== History ==

=== Founding: Harris Committee ===

In 1960, United States Representative [[Oren Harris]] of [[Arkansas]], chairman of the [[House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce]] as well as its Special Subcommittee on Investigations, began investigating broadcast ratings. This led to a series of public hearings beginning March 5, 1963, and ending September 23, 1964, called the ''Harris Committee Hearings on Broadcast Ratings''. The 22-page final report would be produced on January 13, 1966.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beville|first1=Hugh Malcolm|title=Audience Ratings: Radio, Television, and Cable|date=1988|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780805801743|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sALywz73eB4C|language=en}}</ref>{{rp|244}}<ref name=wsj-most-powerful/>

Based on the hearings, the committee felt that rather than government regulation, it would be better for the industry to fund its own organization to review and accredit audience rating services.<ref name=history>{{Cite web|url=http://mediaratingcouncil.org/History.htm|title=History|website=mediaratingcouncil.org|access-date=2017-07-26}}</ref><ref name=wsj-most-powerful/> This organization was founded as the Broadcast Rating Council in 1964.<ref name=nyt-audit-leak>{{cite web|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/16/business/media-business-advertising-industry-group-wants-know-who-leaked-details-audit.html|title = THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; An industry group wants to know who leaked the details of an audit criticizing Nielsen's changes.|last = Elliott|first = Stuart|date = June 16, 2004|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}</ref> The organization would later become the Media Rating Council.<ref name=history/>

The first version of the MRC Minimum Standards became effective on March 31, 1964. The Standards relate to: (a) ethics and operations, (b) disclosures, and (c) electronic delivery. The MRC has maintained and updated the standards since they first became effective.<ref name=mrc-min-standards>{{cite web|url = http://mediaratingcouncil.org/MRC%20Standards.htm|title = MRC Minimum Standards for Media Rating Research|publisher = Media Rating Council|accessdate = July 26, 2017}}</ref>

=== Nielsen rating controversy ===

In 2004, [[Nielsen Corporation|Nielsen]] made updates to its method of measuring television ratings, switching over to "local people meters" in an effort to improve the accuracy of ratings. The new method went through the MRC's accreditation process, including an audit by accounting firm Ernst & Young. Based on the audit, MRC decided on May 28, 2004 to deny accreditation, while praising the overall idea and distinguishing itself from the Don't Count Us Coalition, a set of sharp critics of the new methodology.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/29/business/nielsen-media-s-revised-ratings-system-is-denied-accreditation-by-industry-group.html|title = Nielsen Media's Revised Ratings System Is Denied Accreditation by Industry Group|last = Elliott|first = Stuart|date = May 29, 2004|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}</ref><ref name=nyt-audit-leak/> Nielsen had delayed the rollout of the changes in New York from April 8 to June 3, but decided to continue with the (delayed) rollout, rolling out to New York on June 3, Los Angeles on July 8, and Chicago on August 5.<ref name=nyt-audit-leak/>

In June, the MRC urged media companies to stop the public relations campaign against Nielsen.<ref name=nyt-audit-leak/><ref name=lat-please-dont-diss-nielsen>{{cite web|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jun/09/business/fi-nielsen9|title = Anti-Nielsen Advertising Is Opposed.

=== Viewability standard ===
{{further|Viewable Impression}}
The MRC was part of efforts to push towards a standard for counting ad impressions only if a reasonable fraction of the ad content appears on the user's screen for a sufficiently long period of time  - a quality called "viewability"  The push was resisted by web properties that counted ads as viewed that did not appear on the screen and were not actually seen.<ref name=adweek-viewable>{{cite web|url = http://www.adweek.com/digital/advertisers-ready-make-impression-145801/|title = Advertisers Ready to Make an Impression.

MRC issued its first audit advisory for viewable impressions on November 14, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://mediaratingcouncil.org/VIEWABLE%20IMPRESSION%20ADVISORY%20November%2014,%202012.pdf|title = Viewable Impression Advisory|date = November 14, 2012|accessdate = July 26, 2017|publisher = Media Rating Council}}</ref> Starting 2013, all MRC-accredited researchers and analytics vendors were to begin counting only viewable ad impressions.<ref name=adweek-viewable/>

In October 2016, it was announced that the Media Rating Council had revoked accreditation for two products of Google's [[Doubleclick for Publishers]], namely the mobile web impression measurement and viewability metrics, for missing the one-month compliance deadline with the updated viewability standards announced by the MRC.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.businessinsider.com/google-doubleclick-suspended-from-media-rating-council-accreditation-2016-10|title = Two of Google's metrics have been suspended from a key accreditation service used to measure ads|last = O'Reilly|first = Lara|date = October 12, 2016|accessdate = July 29, 2017|publisher = ''[[Business Insider]]''}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://mashable.com/2016/10/13/google-ad-metrics/#nNtz_SNB_iqK|title = Two Google publisher metrics suspended over missed deadline|last = Kulp|first = Patrick|date = October 13, 2016|accessdate = July 29, 2017|publisher = ''[[Mashable]]''}}</ref> However, Google intended to update its metrics to requalify for MRC accreditation soon.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.adweek.com/digital/google-rolling-out-new-technology-publishers-count-mobile-viewability-174023/|title = Google Is Rolling Out New Technology for Publishers to Count Mobile Viewability.
