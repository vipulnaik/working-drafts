'''GivingTuesday''', often stylized as '''<nowiki>#GivingTuesday</nowiki>''' for the purposes of [[hashtag activism]], is the [[Tuesday]] after [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] in the United States. It is touted as a "global generosity [[social movement|movement]] unleashing the power of people and organizations to transform their communities and the world".<ref name="main">{{cite web |title=GivingTuesday.org |url=https://givingtuesday.org/about |website=GivingTuesday.org |publisher=GivingTuesday |access-date=29 November 2020}}</ref> The organization of the same name is an independent 501c3 nonprofit that supports the global movement.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Philanthropy.com|url=https://www.philanthropy.com/article/givingtuesday-is-now-an-independent-nonprofit/|access-date=2021-06-21|website=www.philanthropy.com}}</ref>

GivingTuesday began as a simple idea in 2012:<ref>{{Cite web|title=#GivingTuesday: Why I Am Participating in the National Day of Giving on November 27, 2012 {{!}} Beth Kanter|url=https://bethkanter.org/givingtuesday/|access-date=2021-06-21|website=bethkanter.org}}</ref> a day that encourages people to do good. The initiative was the brainchild of Henry Timms at the 92nd Street Y in New York. The co-founding organization was the United Nations Foundation.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Otis|first1=John|last2=Tumin|first2=Remy|date=2018-11-24|title=On Giving Tuesday, 'No Act of Giving Is Too Small'|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/neediest-cases/giving-tuesday.html|access-date=2021-06-21|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

The date range is November 27 to December 3, and is always five days after the Thanksgiving holiday. A similar concept was also floated in 2011 at the non-profit Mary-Arrchie Theater Company in Chicago by then-producing director Carlo Lorenzo Garcia, who urged shoppers via [[The Huffington Post]] to take a different approach; to consider donating to charity after they had finished their Cyber Monday shopping. He suggested the name ''Cyber Giving Monday''.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Garcia|first1=Carlo Lorenzo|last2=ContributorActor|last3=Director|last4=Philanthropist|last5=Philanthropic|first5=Founder of Living|date=2011-11-28|title=Who Will You Support On Cyber Giving Monday?|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cyber-monday-charity_b_1115516|access-date=2020-11-26|website=HuffPost|language=en}}</ref>

For its first eight years, GivingTuesday was housed in the 92nd Street Y’s Belfer Center for Innovation & Social Impact, which serves as an incubator for ideas until they grow to a point where they can stand on their own. In June 2019, following the guidance of donors and outside consultants, GivingTuesday split off from 92Y to become an independent organization, with Asha Curran serving as CEO.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Philanthropy.com|url=https://www.philanthropy.com/article/givingtuesday-is-now-an-independent-nonprofit/?cid=gen_sign_in|access-date=2021-06-21|website=www.philanthropy.com}}</ref>

GivingTuesday has received support from The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,<ref>{{Cite web|title=The vital importance of everyday giving: A Q&A with Bill and Melinda Gates|url=https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/articles/giving-summit-2021-bill-melinda|access-date=2021-06-21|website=www.gatesfoundation.org|language=en}}</ref> Craig Newmark Philanthropies,<ref>{{Cite web|title=GivingTuesday Announces New Series Focused on Increasing Generosity for Recovery and Resilience|url=https://www.pr.com/press-release/830881|access-date=2021-06-21|website=PR.com}}</ref> Emerson Collective, Fidelity Charitable,<ref>{{Cite web|last=ideas42|date=2020|title=Fidelity Charitable trustees' initiative 2020 Impact Report|url=https://www.fidelitycharitable.org/content/dam/fc-public/docs/annual-reports/2020-fidelity-charitable-trustees-initiative-impact-report.pdf|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-21|website=Fidelity Charitable}}</ref> the Ford Foundation,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Strub|first=Chris|title=#GivingTuesdayNow Unifies Global Generosity Movement Against Pandemic Woes|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisstrub/2020/04/11/gtnow/|access-date=2021-06-21|website=Forbes|language=en}}</ref> Ford Motor Company,<ref>{{Cite web|title=GivingTuesday Set for Worldwide Celebration of Generosity on December 1|url=https://www.pr.com/press-release/826314|access-date=2021-06-21|website=PR.com}}</ref> PayPal,<ref>{{Cite web|title=GivingTuesday Announces Day of Global Action for Giving and Unity in Response to COVID-19|url=https://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/44339-givingtuesday-announces-day-of-global-action-for-giving-and-unity-in-response-to-covid-19|access-date=2021-06-21|website=www.csrwire.com|language=en}}</ref> and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.<ref>{{Cite web|last=May|first=Maggie|date=2019-12-13|title=Giving Tuesday 2019 Reports Nearly $2 Billion in U.S. Donations|url=https://philanthropywomen.org/womens-funds/givingtuesday2019-reports-nearly-2-billion-in-u-s-donations/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-21|website=Philanthropy Women|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Programs ==
As an organization, GivingTuesday promotes the concept of radical generosity— “generosity not as a benevolence that the haves show to the have-nots but rather an expression of mutuality, solidarity, and reciprocity.”<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-03-11|title=We must embrace radical generosity with or without COVID {{!}} Opinion|url=https://www.newsweek.com/we-must-embrace-radical-generosity-without-covid-opinion-1571485|access-date=2021-06-21|website=Newsweek|language=en}}</ref> To that end, they execute several year-round activities to support the generosity sector around the world.

=== Country Movements ===
GivingTuesday has a global presence through 75 country movements spanning the world, each representing their own unique cultures and needs, while remaining united in their determination to mobilize their countries around generosity and shared humanity. In each country, a team of entrepreneurial leaders work with their own ecosystems of communities, nonprofits, platforms, religious institutions, families, schools, and private sector partners to drive increased giving, connection, and innovation.<ref>{{Cite web|title=GivingTuesday|url=https://www.givingtuesday.org/global/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-21|website=GivingTuesday|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Community Movements ===
At a local and cause level, GivingTuesday is brought to life through an interconnected network of leaders working toward a common goal in their own unique, entrepreneurial ways. Around the world, hundreds of GivingTuesday communities are led by a range of handraisers: community foundations, nonprofits, giving groups, giving circles, and social activists. In the U.S. alone, more than 240 GivingTuesday communities and coalitions drive generosity among people with a common connection to a geography, cause, culture or identity.<ref>{{Cite web|title=GivingTuesday in the United States|url=https://www.givingtuesday.org/united-states/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-21|website=GivingTuesday|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Data Commons ===
The GivingTuesday Data Commons works with partners across sectors and borders to understand the drivers and impacts of generosity, explore giving behaviors and patterns, and use data to inspire more giving around the world.  With over 100 contributing partners and 50 global data labs, the initiative is the largest philanthropic data collaboration ever built.<ref>{{Cite web|title=GivingTuesday Data Commons|url=https://www.givingtuesday.org/insights/givingtuesday-data-commons/|access-date=2021-06-21|website=GivingTuesday|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== #GivingTuesdaySpark ===
Led by and for young people, #GivingTuesdaySpark focuses on amplifying the voices of young people and spreading the culture of generosity in communities all over the world. This robust and inclusive youth- and young adult-led community inspires and connects leaders from 8 to 22 years old to boost the impact of young people assuming leadership and recognizing their power to make change. This program was originally called GivingTuesdayKids.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-10-04|title=Introducing GivingTuesday for Kids|url=https://www.givingtuesday.org/blog/introducing-givingtuesdaykids/|access-date=2021-06-21|website=GivingTuesday|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Starling Collective ===
Starling Collective is a learning lab and innovative fellowship for grassroots organizers, activists, artists and changemakers; it recognizes, supports, and uplifts the extraordinary leadership arising from within communities to meet needs and provide healing—leadership that is often philanthropically underrecognized and undersupported.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-06|title=GivingTuesday Announces the First Cohort of the Starling Collective|url=https://apnews.com/press-release/prcom/technology-79b2abaa17538ce99fc19ab1c44484b4|access-date=2021-06-21|website=AP NEWS}}</ref>

''[[Inside Philanthropy]]'' attributed Giving Tuesday's growing success and global reach to the role that technology companies and founders played in promoting the event, including the $5 million matching grant to [[GiveDirectly]] announced by [[Facebook]] co-founder [[Dustin Moskovitz]]'s foundation [[Good Ventures]] and the $75,000 in matching funds announced by former [[AOL]] CEO [[Steve Case]] for donations made to charities supported by his organization.<ref name=inside-philanthropy-tech>{{cite web|url = http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/tech-philanthropy/2013/12/4/how-tech-philanthropy-propelled-giving-tuesday.html|title = How Tech Philanthropy Propelled Giving Tuesday|last = Gentilucci|first = Michael|date = December 4, 2013|access-date = December 1, 2015|website = [[Inside Philanthropy]]}}</ref>

A January 2015 article in ''[[Nonprofit Quarterly]]'' discussed Giving Tuesday in the context of giving days in general. Giving Tuesday was described as a federated, multi-platform campaign, that involved many different nonprofits and many donation processing platforms, all focusing on a single day so that they could coordinate efforts to raise awareness and publicity. It was contrasted with the Give to the Max Day in [[Minnesota]], that involved many nonprofit participants but used a single donation processor every year to allow for better tracking of the money moved.<ref name=npq-giving-days>{{cite magazine|url = https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/01/20/giving-days-structures-model-crowdfunding-givingtuesday/|title = The Giving Days Model: Collaboration, Federation, or Unification?|last= Boland|first = Steve|date = January 20, 2015|access-date = December 1, 2015|magazine = [[Nonprofit Quarterly]]}}</ref>
