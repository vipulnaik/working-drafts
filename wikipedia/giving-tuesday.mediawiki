'''Giving Tuesday''', often stylized as <nowiki>#GivingTuesday</nowiki> for purposes of [[hashtag activism]], refers to the [[Tuesday]] after [[Thanksgiving (United States)|U.S. Thanksgiving]] in the United States. It is a movement to create an international day of giving at the beginning of the [[Christmas and holiday season]]. Giving Tuesday was started in 2012 by the [[92nd Street Y]] and the [[United Nations Foundation]] as a response to commercialization and consumerism in the post-Thanksgiving season ([[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] and [[Cyber Monday]]).<ref name=mashable-announcement>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2012/10/23/giving-tuesday-skype-cisco/|title = 6 Inspiring Organizations Joining in <nowiki>#GivingTuesday</nowiki>|last = Fox|first = Zoe|date = October 23, 2012|accessdate = February 15, 2014|publisher = [[Mashable]]}}</ref><ref name=community-about>{{cite web |url=http://community.givingtuesday.org/Page/About |title=: About |publisher=Giving Tuesday |accessdate=February 15, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225113736/http://community.givingtuesday.org/Page/About |archivedate=February 25, 2014 |df= }}</ref>

''[[Inside Philanthropy]]'' attributed Giving Tuesday's growing success and global reach to the role that technology companies and founders played in promoting the event, including the $5 million matching grant to [[GiveDirectly]] announced by [[Facebook]] co-founder [[Dustin Moskovitz]]'s foundation [[Good Ventures]] and the $75,000 in matching funds announced by former [[AOL]] CEO [[Steve Case]] for donations made to charities supported [http://www.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.8858189/k.4773/Giving_Tuesday_at_Save_the_Children.htm by] his organization.<ref name=inside-philanthropy-tech>{{cite web|url = http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/tech-philanthropy/2013/12/4/how-tech-philanthropy-propelled-giving-tuesday.html|title = How Tech Philanthropy Propelled Giving Tuesday|last = Gentilucci|first = Michael|date = December 4, 2013|accessdate = December 1, 2015|publisher = ''[[Inside Philanthropy]]''}}</ref>

A January 2015 article in ''[[Nonprofit Quarterly]]'' discussed Giving Tuesday in the context of giving days in general. Giving Tuesday was described as a federated, multi-platform campaign, that involved many different nonprofits and many donation processing platforms, all focusing on a single day so that they could coordinate efforts to raise awareness and publicity. It was contrasted with the [[Give to the Max Day]] in [[Minnesota]], that involved many nonprofit participants but used a single donation processor every year to allow for better tracking of the money moved.<ref name=npq-giving-days>{{cite web|url = https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/01/20/giving-days-structures-model-crowdfunding-givingtuesday/|title = The Giving Days Model: Collaboration, Federation, or Unification?|last= Boland|first = Steve|date = January 20, 2015|accessdate = December 1, 2015|publisher = ''[[Nonprofit Quarterly]]''}}</ref>
