'''GivingTuesday''', often stylized as '''<nowiki>#GivingTuesday</nowiki>''' for the purposes of [[hashtag activism]], refers to the [[Tuesday]] after [[Thanksgiving (United States)|U.S. Thanksgiving]] in the United States. It is a global [[Social movement|movement]] that unleashes the power of people and organizations to transform their communities and the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=GivingTuesday.org |url=https://givingtuesday.org/about |website=GivingTuesday.org |publisher=GivingTuesday |accessdate=5 November 2020}}</ref>

Giving Tuesday was initially started in 2011 and called Cyber Giving Monday and was the brainchild of the non-profit Mary-Arrchie Theater Company and then producing director Carlo Lorenzo Garcia urging donors to take a different approach to filling up an online virtual cart with goods and published nationally in the Huffington Post.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Garcia|first=Carlo Lorenzo|last2=ContributorActor|last3=Director|last4=Philanthropist|last5=Philanthropic|first5=Founder of Living|date=2011-11-28|title=Who Will You Support On Cyber Giving Monday?|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cyber-monday-charity_b_1115516|access-date=2020-11-26|website=HuffPost|language=en}}</ref> The push was moved to Tuesday the following year as to not compete with Cyber Monday by the [[92nd Street Y]] and the [[United Nations Foundation]] as a response to commercialization and consumerism in the post-Thanksgiving season ([[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] and [[Cyber Monday]]). The date range is November 27 to December 3, and is always five days after the holiday.

''[[Inside Philanthropy]]'' attributed Giving Tuesday's growing success and global reach to the role that technology companies and founders played in promoting the event, including the $5 million matching grant to [[GiveDirectly]] announced by [[Facebook]] co-founder [[Dustin Moskovitz]]'s foundation [[Good Ventures]] and the $75,000 in matching funds announced by former [[AOL]] CEO [[Steve Case]] for donations made to charities supported by his organization.<ref name=inside-philanthropy-tech>{{cite web|url = http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/tech-philanthropy/2013/12/4/how-tech-philanthropy-propelled-giving-tuesday.html|title = How Tech Philanthropy Propelled Giving Tuesday|last = Gentilucci|first = Michael|date = December 4, 2013|accessdate = December 1, 2015|website = [[Inside Philanthropy]]}}</ref>

A January 2015 article in ''[[Nonprofit Quarterly]]'' discussed Giving Tuesday in the context of giving days in general. Giving Tuesday was described as a federated, multi-platform campaign, that involved many different nonprofits and many donation processing platforms, all focusing on a single day so that they could coordinate efforts to raise awareness and publicity. It was contrasted with the Give to the Max Day in [[Minnesota]], that involved many nonprofit participants but used a single donation processor every year to allow for better tracking of the money moved.<ref name=npq-giving-days>{{cite magazine|url = https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/01/20/giving-days-structures-model-crowdfunding-givingtuesday/|title = The Giving Days Model: Collaboration, Federation, or Unification?|last= Boland|first = Steve|date = January 20, 2015|accessdate = December 1, 2015|magazine = [[Nonprofit Quarterly]]}}</ref>
