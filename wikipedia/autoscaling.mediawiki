'''Autoscaling''', also spelled '''auto scaling''' or '''auto-scaling''', and sometimes also called '''automatic scaling''', is a method used in [[cloud computing]], whereby the amount of computational resources in a server farm, typically measured in terms of the number of active servers, scales automatically based on the load on the farm. It is closely related to, and builds upon, the idea of [[load balancing (computing)|load balancing]].<ref name=eecs-berkeley>{{cite web|url = http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2009/EECS-2009-28.pdf|title = Above the Clouds: A Berkeley View of Cloud Computing|date = February 10, 2009|publisher = Berkeley EECS|accessdate = March 21, 2015}}</ref><ref name=aws>{{cite web|url=http://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/|title = Auto Scaling|publisher = [[Amazon Web Services]]|accessdate = March 21, 2015}}</ref>

==Advantages==

Autoscaling offers the following advantages:

* For companies running their own web server infrastructure, autoscaling typically means allowing some servers to go to sleep during times of low load, saving on electricity costs (as well as water costs if water is being used to cool the machines).<ref name=facebook/> 
* For companies using infrastructure hosted in the cloud, autoscaling can mean lower bills, because most cloud providers charge based on total usage rather than maximum capacity.<ref name=newvem/> 
* Even for companies that cannot reduce the total compute capacity they run or pay for at any given time, autoscaling can help by allowing the company to run less time-sensitive workloads on machines that get freed up by autoscaling during times of low traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/09/creating-your-own-ec2-spot-market.html|title = Creating Your Own EC2 Spot Market|last = Park|first = Andrew|last2 = Denlinger|first2 = Darrell|last3 = Watson|first3 = Coburn|date = September 18, 2015|accessdate = December 16, 2016|publisher = [[Netflix]]}}</ref>
* Autoscaling solutions, such as the one offered by Amazon Web Services, can also take care of replacing unhealthy instances and therefore protecting somewhat against hardware, network, and application failures.<ref name=cloudonaut/>
* Autoscaling can offer greater uptime and more availability in cases where production workloads are variable and unpredictable.

Autoscaling differs from having a fixed daily, weekly, or yearly cycle of server use in that it is responsive to actual usage patterns, and thus reduces the potential downside of having too few or too many servers for the traffic load. For instance, if traffic is usually lower at midnight, then a static scaling solution might schedule some servers to sleep at night, but this might result in downtime on a night where people happen to use the Internet more (for instance, due to a viral news event). Autoscaling, on the other hand, can handle unexpected traffic spikes better.<ref name=facebook/><ref name=netflix/>

==Terminology==

In the list below, we use the terminology used by [[Amazon Web Services]] (AWS).<ref name=aws-documentation>{{cite web|url = http://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/WhatIsAutoScaling.html|title = What Is Auto Scaling?|publisher = [[Amazon Web Services]]|accessdate = December 16, 2016}}</ref> However, alternative names are noted and terminology that is specific to the names of Amazon services is not used for the names.

|-
| Scaling policy (or autoscaling policy) || A policy that specifies a change to the autoscaling group's desired capacity (or sometimes, its minimum and maximum size) in response to metrics crossing specific thresholds. Scaling policies can have associated cooldown periods, which prevent additional scaling actions from occurring immediately after a speicific scaling action. Changes to desired capacity could be incremental (increase or decrease by a specific number) or could specify a new value of the desired capacity. Policies that increase the desired capacity are called "scaling out" or "scaling up" policies, and policies that decrease the desired capacity are called "scaling in" or "scaling down" policies ||
|-

A health check may be based on whether the instance still exists and is reachable, or it could be based on whether the instance is still registered and in service with an associated load balancer ||
|-
| Launch configuration || A description of the parameters and scripts used when launching a new instance. This includes the instance type, purchase options (such as spot versus on-demand in the case of AWS), possible availability zones for launch, machine image, and scripts to run on launch || Instance template (Google Cloud Platform)

Various best practice guides for AWS use suggest using its autoscaling feature even in cases where the load is not variable. That is because autoscaling offers two other advantages: automatic replacement of any instances that become unhealthy for any reason (such as hardware failure, network failure, or application error), and automatic replacement of spot instances that get interrupted for price or capacity reasons, making it more feasible to use spot instances for production purposes.<ref name=cloudonaut>{{cite web|url=https://cloudonaut.io/5-aws-mistakes-you-should-avoid/|title = 5 AWS mistakes you should avoid|last = Wittig|first = Michael|publisher = cloudonaut|date = December 26, 2015|accessdate = December 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://wblinks.com/notes/aws-tips-i-wish-id-known-before-i-started/|title = AWS Tips I Wish I'd Known Before I Started.

== Alternatives to autoscaling ==

Autoscaling is a ''reactive'' method of dealing with traffic scaling: scaling only happens in response to real-time changes in metrics. In some cases, this reactive approach to scaling is insufficient. Two other kinds of scaling are described below. Autoscaling solutions such as that by AWS allow the use of these types of scaling with existing autoscaling groups, even though they are conceptually somewhat different from autoscaling.

=== Scheduled scaling ===

This is an approach to scaling where changes are made to the minimum size, maximum size, or desired capacity of the autoscaling group at specific times of day. Scheduled scaling is useful, for instance, if there is a known traffic load increase or decrease at specific times of the day, but the change is too sudden for autoscaling to respond fast enough. AWS autoscaling groups support scheduled scaling.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/schedule_time.html|title = Scheduled Scaling|publisher = [[Amazon Web Services]]|accessdate = December 16, 2016}}</ref>

=== Predictive scaling ===

This approach to scaling uses [[predictive analytics]]. The idea is to combine recent usage trends with historical usage data as well as other kinds of data to predict usage in the future, and scale based on these predictions. For parts of their infrastructure and specific workloads, Netflix found that Scryer, their predictive analytics engine, gave better results than Amazon's autoscaling. In particular, it was better for:<ref name=netflix-scryer>{{cite web|last1=Jacobson|first1=Daniel|last2=Yuan|first2=Danny|last3=Joshi|first3=Neeraj|title=Scryer: Netflix’s Predictive Auto Scaling Engine|url=http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/11/scryer-netflixs-predictive-auto-scaling.html|website=The [[Netflix]] Tech Blog|publisher=Netflix|accessdate=28 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=morpheus>{{cite web|url = https://www.morpheusdata.com/blog/2016-11-02-autoscaling-how-the-cloud-provides-a-tremendous-boost/|tite = Autoscaling: How the Cloud Provides a Tremendous Boost|date = November 2, 2016|accessdate = December 16, 2016|publisher = Morpheus}}</ref>

* Identifying huge spikes in demand in the near future and getting capacity ready a little in advance
* Dealing with large-scale outages, such as failure of entire availability zones and regions
* Dealing with variable traffic patterns, providing more flexibility on the rate of scaling out or in based on the typical level and rate of change in demand at various times of day
