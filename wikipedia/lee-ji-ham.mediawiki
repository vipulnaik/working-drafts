== Early life ==

Lee Ji-ham was born in [[Boryeong]] in [[Chungcheong Province]] in 1517, during the reign of [[Jungjong of Joseon]]. He was a sixth-generation descendant of Korean writer and poet [[Yi Saek|Lee Saek]] who had served the [[Goryeo]] dynasty, the predecessor to the Joseon dynasty.<ref name=kbs/> Ji-ham's father died when he was fourteen. After that, he studied under his elder brother as well as [[Seo Gyeong-Deok]], a neo-Confucian naturalistic philosopher, who taught him medicine, mathematics, astronomy, geography, and many other subjects.

When his 10-foot mud hut remained intact even after a big flood, Lee Ji-ham earned the moniker of Tojeung, meaning "a person who lives in an earthen pavillion."
