== Career ==

=== United States Department of Commerce (1941–1950) ===

From 1941 to 1950, Gilbert was chief of the National Income Division of the [[United States Department of Commerce]].<ref name=nyt-obit/><ref name=wapo-obit/>  While there, he was part of the foundational work done by the United States to develop a system of national income accounting and GDP calculation. In that capacity, he had disagreements with economist [[Simon Kuznets]] (the founder of national income accounting in the United States). Gilbert and his colleagues were of the view that these calculations should be done to serve United States government fiscal policy, and that government spending should be included in the GDP calculations.<ref name=gdp-brief-history>{{cite web|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/GDP.html?id=t7pKCAAAQBAJ|title = GDP: A Brief but Affectionate History|last = Coyle|first = Diane|accessdate = October 17, 2017}}</ref>{{rp|27-28}}

While at the U.S. Department of Commerce, Gilbert co-edited a volume of ''Studies in Income and Wealth'' (a book series) with [[Dorothy Brady]] and Kuznets. The volume was published in 1946.<ref>{{cite book|url = http://papers.nber.org/books/unkn46-2|title = Studies in Income and Wealth|date = January 1, 1946|accessdate = October 19, 2017}}</ref>

=== Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (1951–1960) ===

From 1951 to 1960, Gilbert worked as an economist at the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC),<ref name=nyt-obit/><ref name=wapo-obit/> which would be renamed in 1961 to [[OECD]] (its present name). The OEEC had, since the start of the [[Marshall Plan]] in 1946, been tasked with monitoring spending and economic growth in Europe.<ref name=gdp-modernity-making>{{cite book|title = The Great Invention: The Story of GDP and the Making and Unmaking of the Modern World|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fE89DAAAQBAJ|accessdate = October 16, 2017}}</ref>{{rp|35}} While there, he collaborated with [[Irvin B. Kravis]] on ''An International Comparison of National Products and the Purchasing Power of Currencies'', a pioneering work on international comparison of production and purchasing power.<ref name=wapo-obit/> This was an early precursor to the [[International Comparison Program]] that would be created in 1968 at the University of Pennsylvania<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/ICPEXT/0,,contentMDK:22377133~menuPK:6782010~pagePK:60002244~piPK:62002388~theSitePK:270065,00.html |title=International Comparison Program - History |accessdate=October 5, 2017}}</ref> which in turn would lead to ''Real GDP Per Capita for More Than One Hundred Countries'' by Kravis, [[Alan W. Heston]] and [[Robert Summers]] in 1978, the first version of the [[Penn World Table]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://voxeu.org/article/newer-better-penn-world-table-growth-estimates |title=Is newer better?
