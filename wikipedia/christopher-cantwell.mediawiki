Cantwell is an admirer of anarcho-capitalist [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]], who wrote: "There can be no tolerance toward democrats and communists in a libertarian social order. They will have to be physically separated and removed from society."<ref>https://christophercantwell.com/product/physically-remove-democrats-3x10-sticker/</ref> This is the basis for Cantwell's frequent reference to "physical removal" - often made specific as "helicopter rides" in the manner of Chilean dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]], who had leftist opponents thrown out of helicopters over the sea.<ref>https://christophercantwell.com/product/radical-agenda-helicopter-t-shirt-short-sleeves/</ref>
