'''Family Fairness''' was a program run by the [[Immigration and Naturalization Services]] in the United States from late 1987 to late 1990. The initial version was introduced in late 1987 by then INS Commissioner [[Alan C. Nelson]], working under then Attorney General [[Edwin Meese]] and then President [[Ronald Reagan]]. An expansion of the program was introduced in early 1990 by INS Commissioner [[Gene McNary]] working under then Attorney General [[Dick Thornburgh]] and then United States President [[George H. W. Bush]].<ref name=status-report>{{cite journal|title = Family Fairness: A Status Report|last = Guendelsberger|first = John W.|journal = International Migration Review|volume = 15|year = 1992|pages = 45-57|url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/23143114}}</ref><ref name=aic-house-testimony>{{cite web|url = http://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU00/20150225/103010/HHRG-114-JU00-20150225-SD003.pdf|title = Statement of the American Immigration Council submitted to the Committee on the Judiciary of the U.S. House of Representatives hearing on "The Uncostitutionality of Obama's Executive Actions on Immigration"|date = February 25, 2015|accessdate = FFebruary 22, 2017}}</ref><ref name=aic>{{cite web|url = https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/reagan-bush-family-fairness-chronological-history|title = Reagan-Bush Family Fairness: A Chronological History|date = December 9, 2014|accessdate = February 5, 2017|publisher = American Immigration Council}}</ref><ref name=huffpo>{{cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marshall-fitz/the-bush-family-fairness-_b_6319760.html|title = The Bush Family Fairness Plan Is the True Precursor to the President’s Executive Actions on Immigration|last = Fitz|first = Marshall|date = December 15, 2014|publisher = ''[[Huffington Post]]''}}</ref><ref name=thehill>{{cite web|url = http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/219463-when-reagan-and-ghw-bush-took-bold-executive-action-on|title = When Reagan and GHW Bush took bold executive action on immigration|last = Noferi|first = Mark|date = October 2, 2014|accessdate = February 5, 2016|publisher = ''[[The Hill]]''}}</ref> The program was created through executive action, in order to meet the problem of "split-eligibility" families created by the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]], pending legislation that would address the issue.<ref name=aic/> The [[Immigration Act of 1990]] replaced it with a legislatively sanctioned Family Unity Program, that continues to be in force today.<ref name=aic/>

== History ==

=== Background ===

On November 6, 1986, then-United States President [[Ronald Reagan]] signed the Simpson-Mazzoli [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]]. The Act was the result of a bill sponsored by [[Romano L. Mazzoli]], a Democratic representative from [[Kentucky]], and [[Alan R. Simpson]], a Republican senator from [[Wyoming]], who chaired their respective immigration subcommittees in Congress. The effort was assisted by the recommendations of the bipartisan Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by Rev. [[Theodore Hesburgh]], then President of the [[University of Notre Dame]]. The bill was passed after several iterations and required compromises between growers' groups, the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]], civil rights advocates, and politicians' interest in cracking down on illegal immigration.

Two important classes of people that the Act granted temporary legal status and a path to permanent residency were:<ref name=aic/>

# People continuously present in the United States since January 1, 1982
# Special agricultural workers (SAW)

At the time of the passage of the Act, it was estimated that 3 million people would be eligible to legalize based on these provisions, although the number would rise later. However, the IRCA provided no special provision for legalization for the spouses and children of eligible people if they did not independently qualify; they would have to "wait in line"; however, they might eventually become eligible once the originally eligible applicant had acquired permanent residency or citizenship.<ref name=aic/><ref name=blackman>{{cite web|url = http://joshblackman.com/blog/2016/04/21/more-on-family-fairness/|title = More on Family Fairness|last = Blackman|first = Josh|date = APril 21, 2016|accessdate = February 21, 2017}}</ref>

This led to a problem of "split-eligibility" families, where some members of the family were eligible for temporary legal status and others were not. The issue was highlighted by the [[National Conference of Catholic Bishops]], that asked President Ronald Reagan to address the issue. The [[Los Angeles]] Catholic Archdiocese estimated that 30% of the legalization applications it was assisting involved split-eligibility families.<ref name=aic/>(get more references independent of AIC)

To address this, [[John Chafee]], a Republican Senator (and former Governor) from [[Rhode Island]] proposed an amendment to an unrelated bill that would give spouses and children of IRCA-eligible individuals a path to legalization. The amendment was defeated by a 55-45 vote, and was the subject of criticism by Alan Simpson (co-sponsor of the original IRCA) who said that the amendment was against the spirit of the original legislation and the careful balance it had struck.<ref name=aic/><ref name=aic-house-testimony/>

=== First announcement ===

Until the announcement of the Family Fairness executive action, the INS interpreted the IRCA strictly: only people who were eligible according to the IRCA rules were provided temporary legal status. On October 21, 1987, [[Alan C. Nelson]], Commissioner of the [[Immigration and Naturalization Services]] at the time, announced the "Family Fairness" executive action. Nelson was working under Attorney General [[Edwin Meese]] and President [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref name=aic/><ref name=factcheck>{{cite web|url = http://www.factcheck.org/2014/11/obamas-actions-same-as-past-presidents/|title = Obama’s Actions ‘Same’ as Past Presidents?|last = Farley|first = Robert|date = November 21, 2014|accessdate = February 22, 2017|publisher = FactCheck}}</ref><ref name=status-report/> The executive action allowed for deferred deportation for:<ref name=factcheck/><ref name=aic/>

* Children if ''both'' their parents (or the single parent, if they were living with only one parent) were eligible for legal status under IRCA.<ref name=aic/><ref name=factcheck/>
* Spouses of IRCA-eligible individuals ''only'' in case of ''compelling or humanitarian factors'', with the fact of marriage alone being insufficient.<ref name=aic/><ref name=factcheck/>

(Condition on physical presence on or before November 6, 1986?)
