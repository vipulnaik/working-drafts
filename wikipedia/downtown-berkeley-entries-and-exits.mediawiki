Below is data for average weekday entries and exits between the Ashby BART and other BART stations as of January 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bart.gov/about/reports/ridership|title = Ridership Reports|accessdate = February 23, 2017}}</ref> The transit time and one-way trip cost is based on BART's fares and schedules booklet, last updated in February 2016, and valid as of January 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/docs/F_S%20FEB%202016%20.pdf|title = BART Fares and Schedules|accessdate = February 23, 2017|date = February 1, 2016|publisher = [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]]}}</ref> A few notes for interpretation:

* Downtown Berkeley serves commuters in both directions: it serves people who commute to downtown Berkeley every day for work or study (it is the closest station to the [[University of California, Berkeley]]). Most of these commuters come from nearby areas in Oakland, Berkeley, El Cerrito, and Richmond. It also caters to a large residential population that works in San Francisco or Oakland.
* The following kinds of stations will have higher entry/exit counts: nearby stations, stations in downtowns (Berkeley, Oakland, and San Francisco, stations with transfers, end-of-line stations, and airport stations.
* For airports in particular, people are more likely to take the train when going out from the airport than when going to the airport, possibly because they are on a less tight timeline when leaving the airport.
* Some daily commuters don't enter and exit at the same station. For instance, commuters from downtown Berkeley who work in downtown San Francisco exit at an earlier station in the morning and enter at a station farther south when returning (e.g., exit at Embarcadero in the morning and enter at Montgomery in the evening). This is to get on a less crowded train. A similar phenomenon is observed between the two downtown Oakland stations.
