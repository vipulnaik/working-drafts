==Philanthropy==

Moskovitz co-founded the philanthropic organization [[Good Ventures]] with his girlfriend (and now wife) Cari Tuna in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.facebook.com/notes/good-ventures/our-vision-mission-initial-approach-to-giving/461742803854617| title = Our vision, mission & initial approach|last = Tuna|first = Cari}}</ref> In June 2012, Good Ventures announced a close partnership with charity evaluator [[GiveWell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.givewell.org/2012/06/28/givewell-and-good-ventures/|title = GiveWell and Good Ventures|author = Holden|date = 2012-06-28}}</ref> [[Good Ventures]] has donated approximately $100 million from 2011 onward to GiveWell top charities [[Against Malaria Foundation]], [[GiveDirectly]], [[Schistosomiasis Control Initiative]], and [[Deworm the World Initiative]], as well as standout charities (see [[Good Ventures#Grants to GiveWell-recommended charities]] for more).

For the [[2016 United States Presidential election]], Moskovitz announced that he and his wife are donating $20 million to support [[Hillary Clinton]], the Democratic Party nominee, arguing that the dangers of a Trump presidency are significant, and that they are making their donation despite being skeptical of allowing large donors to influence election cycles through money.<ref name="2016 Donation">{{cite web|url = http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/politics/facebook-cofounder-gift-democrats|title = Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz commits $20M to help beat Trump|date = September 9, 2016|accessdate = September 22, 2016|publisher = ''[[CNN]]''}}</ref> The ''[[New York Times]]'' quoted Moskovitz's blog post on the subject: "The Republican Party, and Donald Trump in particular, is running on a zero-sum vision, stressing a false contest between their constituency and the rest of the world."<ref name=nytimes-2016-donation>{{cite web|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/us/politics/facebook-trump-dustin-moskovitz.html|title = Dustin Moskovitz, Facebook Co-Founder, Pledges $20 Million to Aid Democrats|last = Confessore|first = Nicholas|date = September 9, 2016|accessdate = September 22, 2016|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}</ref><ref name=compelled-to-act/> This makes him the 3rd largest donor in the 2016 campaigns.<ref name="2016 Donation"/>
