The '''streamlined filing compliance procedures''' (called the ''streamlined procedures''' for short when the context is clear) is a set of procedures offered by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] in the [[United States]] to help United States taxpayers get back in compliance on the fronts of paying taxes related to their foreign financial assets as well as submitting all required information returns, after having fallen out of compliance in one or more previous tax years.<ref name=irs-sfcp>{{cite web|url = https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/streamlined-filing-compliance-procedures|title = Streamlined Filing Compliance Procedures|publisher = Internal Revenue Service|accessdate = June 29, 2024}}</ref>

==Filing process==

===Foreign versus domestic cases===

There are two versions of the streamlined procedures:

* Streamlined Foreign Offshore Procedures: This version of the procedures is for individual U.S. taxpayers or their estates who meet the non-residency requirement.<ref name=irs-sfop>{{cite web|url = https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/us-taxpayers-residing-outside-the-united-states|title = U.S. taxpayers residing outside the United States|publisher = Internal Revenue Service|accessdate = June 29, 2024}}</ref> The form used for these is Form 14653: Certification by U.S. Person Residing Outside of the United States for Streamlined Foreign Offshore Procedures.<ref name=14653>{{cite web|url = https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14653.pdf|title = Form 14653: Certification by U.S. Person Residing Outside of the United States for Streamlined Foreign Offshore Procedures|publisher = Internal Revenue Service|accessdate = June 29, 2024}}</ref>
** For United States citizens and lawful permanent residents, this is based on the [[physical presence test]] being satisfied for any of the past three years. Specifically, it is defined as follows: "in any one or more of the most recent three years for which the U.S. tax return due date (or properly applied for extended due date) has passed, the individual did not have a U.S. abode and the individual was physically outside the United States for at least 330 full days."
** For those who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents, this is based on the [[Substantial Presence Test]] failing for any of the past three years. Specifically, it is defined as follows: "in any one or more of the last three years for which the U.S. tax return due date (or properly applied for extended due date) has passed, the individual did not meet the substantial presence test of IRC section 7701(b)(3)."
* Streamlined Domestic Offshore Procedures: This version of the procedures is for taxpayers who fail to meet the non-residency requirement that would make them eligible for the Streamlined Foreign Offshore Procedures. The form used for these is Form 14654: Certification by U.S. Person Residing in the United States for Streamlined Domestic Offshore Procedures.<ref name=f14654>{{cite web|url = https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14654.pdf|title = Form 14654: Certification by U.S. Person Residing in the United States for Streamlined Domestic Offshore Procedures|publisher = Internal Revenue Service|accessdate = June 29, 2024}}</ref>

The Streamlined Foreign Offshore Procedures and the Streamlined Domestic Offshore Procedures differ primarily in that the latter procedures impose a 5% miscellaneous offshore penalty, whereas there is no similar offshore penalty for the Streamline Foreign Offshore Procedures. See [[#Miscellaneous offshore penalty in the domestic case]] for more.

===Filing details===

The IRS documentation on both the foreign and domestic cases of the streamlined procedures include instructions on the filing process. A summary is below:<ref name=irs-sfop/><ref name=irs-sdop/>

* For filing delinquent FBARs, the taxpayer needs to submit it online on the FinCEN website, with "Streamlined Filing Compliance Procedures" in the explanation box for the reason for filing late.
* The rest of the stuff being filed needs to be included in a single packet sent to an IRS address (specified on the website) with an Attn note saying "Streamlined Foreign Offshore" or "Streamlined Domestic Offshore" respectively. This packet must include:
** Amended tax returns for each of the applicable years (up to the past 3 years) including all required information returns (such as Forms 3520, 5471, and 8938) "even if these information returns would normally not be submitted with the Form 1040 had the taxpayer filed a complete and accurate original return." Delinquent original returns are ''not'' allowed. '''The first page of each amended tax return and each information return included must have at its top a note in red''' saying "Streamlined Foreign Offshore" or "Streamlined Domestic Offshore" as the case may be. The instructions call this '''critical''' to making sure the returns are processed through the special procedures.
** Filled and signed Form 14653 (for the foreign case) or Form 14654 (for the domestic case), both an original version '''and''' copies included with each amended tax return. The filled form includes a summary of the amounts involved by year; in the case of Form 14654, this is also where the 5% miscellaneous offshort penalty is calculated. This form is also where the taxpayer certifies that the failures were not willful, and where the taxpayer can include more explanation.
** Payment of the amout due, for instance, in the form of a check. If the payment amount is not correct, the IRS will issue a refund or notice of balance due.

===After achieving compliance===

Once the streamlined filing has been submitted, the taxpayer must continue filing taxes for future years normally.<ref name=irs-sfcp/>

==Effect on taxes, interest, and penalties==

===Streamlined filing does not reduce taxes or interest on taxes===

Even with a streamlined filing, any taxes that were due are still owed by the taxpayer. Moreover, if the taxes are past the filing deadline for taxes, interest on these taxes is also due.

===Properly done streamlined filing (both foreign and domestic) eliminates many penalties that may otherwise apply===

Eligible taxpayers who do a proper streamlined filing eliminate many penalties that may otherwise apply: failure-to-file penalty, failure-to-pay penalty, accuracy-related penalty, information return penalties (for failure to include required information returns such as Forms 3520, 5471, and 8938 with their tax returns) and FBAR penalties (for failure to file or inaccuracies). This includes penalties for years prior to the years covered by the streamlined filing i(if not assessed already); in particular, if the taxpayer fully catches up with FBAR for the past 6 years and with information returns and tax reporting for the past 3 years, the taxpayer will no longer have to pay the FBAR penalty or information return penalties not just for those past years but for prior years as well, if such penalties have not already been assessed.<ref name=irs-sfop/><ref name=irs-sdop/>

===5% miscellaneous offshore penalty in the domestic case==

The Streamlined Domestic Offshore Procedures include a 5% miscellaneou offshore penalty on the end-of-year balance for assets for which one of these is true:<ref name=irs-sdop/>

* not reported on the FBAR ([[FinCEN Form 114]]) (in any year over the past 6 years)
* not report on [[Form 8938]] (in any year over the past 3 years)
* income (such as interest and dividend income) from the asset not reported in the tax return (in any year over the past 3 years)

For each year, the total value of foreign financial assets subject to the penalty is calculated, then the maximum of the values across all years is taken; the penalty is 5% of this amount. The calculations are done as part of Form 14654.<ref name=f14654/>
