The '''streamlined filing compliance procedures''' (called the ''streamlined procedures'' for short when the context is clear) is a set of procedures offered by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] in the [[United States]] to help United States taxpayers get back in compliance on the fronts of paying taxes related to their foreign financial assets as well as submitting all required information returns, after having fallen out of compliance in one or more previous tax years.<ref name=irs-sfcp>{{cite web|url = https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/streamlined-filing-compliance-procedures|title = Streamlined Filing Compliance Procedures|publisher = Internal Revenue Service|accessdate = June 29, 2024}}</ref>

==Filing process==

===Foreign versus domestic cases===

There are two versions of the streamlined procedures:

* Streamlined Foreign Offshore Procedures: This version of the procedures is for individual U.S. taxpayers or their estates who meet the non-residency requirement.<ref name=irs-sfop>{{cite web|url = https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/us-taxpayers-residing-outside-the-united-states|title = U.S. taxpayers residing outside the United States|publisher = Internal Revenue Service|accessdate = June 29, 2024}}</ref><ref name=irs-sfo-faq>{{cite web|url = https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/streamlined-filing-compliance-procedures-for-us-taxpayers-residing-outside-the-united-states-frequently-asked-questions-and-answers|title = Streamlined Filing Compliance Procedures for U.S. Taxpayers Residing Outside the United States Frequently Asked Questions and Answers|publisher = Internal Revenue Service|accessdate = June 29, 2024}}</ref> The form used for these is Form 14653: Certification by U.S. Person Residing Outside of the United States for Streamlined Foreign Offshore Procedures.<ref name=14653>{{cite web|url = https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14653.pdf|title = Form 14653: Certification by U.S. Person Residing Outside of the United States for Streamlined Foreign Offshore Procedures|publisher = Internal Revenue Service|accessdate = June 29, 2024}}</ref>
** For United States citizens and lawful permanent residents, this is based on the [[physical presence test]] being satisfied for any of the past three years. Specifically, it is defined as follows: "in any one or more of the most recent three years for which the U.S. tax return due date (or properly applied for extended due date) has passed, the individual did not have a U.S. abode and the individual was physically outside the United States for at least 330 full days."
** For those who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents, this is based on the [[Substantial Presence Test]] failing for any of the past three years. Specifically, it is defined as follows: "in any one or more of the last three years for which the U.S. tax return due date (or properly applied for extended due date) has passed, the individual did not meet the substantial presence test of IRC section 7701(b)(3)."
* Streamlined Domestic Offshore Procedures: This version of the procedures is for taxpayers who fail to meet the non-residency requirement that would make them eligible for the Streamlined Foreign Offshore Procedures.<ref name=irs-sdop>{{cite web|url = https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/us-taxpayers-residing-in-the-united-states|title = U.S. taxpayers residing in the United States|publisher = Internal Revenue Service|accessdate = June 29, 2024}}</ref><ref name=irs-sdo-faq>{{cite web|url = https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/streamlined-filing-compliance-procedures-for-us-taxpayers-residing-in-the-united-states-frequently-asked-questions-and-answers|title = Streamlined Filing Compliance Procedures for U.S. Taxpayers Residing in the United States Frequently Asked Questions and Answers|publisher = Internal Revenue Service|accessdate = June 29, 2024}}</ref> The form used for these is Form 14654: Certification by U.S. Person Residing in the United States for Streamlined Domestic Offshore Procedures.<ref name=f14654>{{cite web|url = https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14654.pdf|title = Form 14654: Certification by U.S. Person Residing in the United States for Streamlined Domestic Offshore Procedures|publisher = Internal Revenue Service|accessdate = June 29, 2024}}</ref>

The Streamlined Foreign Offshore Procedures and the Streamlined Domestic Offshore Procedures differ primarily in that the latter procedures impose a 5% miscellaneous offshore penalty, whereas there is no similar offshore penalty for the Streamline Foreign Offshore Procedures. See [[#Miscellaneous offshore penalty in the domestic case]] for more.

===Filing details===

The IRS documentation on both the foreign and domestic cases of the streamlined procedures include instructions on the filing process. A summary is below:<ref name=irs-sfop/><ref name=irs-sdop/>

* For filing delinquent FBARs, the taxpayer needs to submit it online on the FinCEN website, with "Streamlined Filing Compliance Procedures" in the explanation box for the reason for filing late.
* The rest of the stuff being filed needs to be included in a single packet sent to an IRS address (specified on the website) with an Attn note saying "Streamlined Foreign Offshore" or "Streamlined Domestic Offshore" respectively. This packet must include:
** Amended tax returns for each of the applicable years (up to the past 3 years) including all required information returns (such as Forms 3520, 5471, and 8938) "even if these information returns would normally not be submitted with the Form 1040 had the taxpayer filed a complete and accurate original return." Delinquent original returns are ''not'' allowed. '''The first page of each amended tax return and each information return included must have at its top a note in red''' saying "Streamlined Foreign Offshore" or "Streamlined Domestic Offshore" as the case may be. The instructions call this '''critical''' to making sure the returns are processed through the special procedures.
** Filled and signed Form 14653 (for the foreign case) or Form 14654 (for the domestic case), both an original version '''and''' copies included with each amended tax return. The filled form includes a summary of the amounts involved by year; in the case of Form 14654, this is also where the 5% miscellaneous offshort penalty is calculated. This form is also where the taxpayer certifies that the failures were not willful, and where the taxpayer can include more explanation.
** Payment of the amout due, for instance, in the form of a check. If the payment amount is not correct, the IRS will issue a refund or notice of balance due.

===After achieving compliance===

Once the streamlined filing has been submitted, the taxpayer must continue filing taxes for future years normally.<ref name=irs-sfcp/>

==Effect other ongoing or past tax processes may have on streamlined filing==

===Streamlined filing is not available if the IRS has initiated a civil examination of the taxpayer's returns for any taxable year===

According to the IRS webpage: "If the IRS has initiated a civil examination of taxpayer's returns for any taxable year, regardless of whether the examination relates to undisclosed foreign financial assets, the taxpayer will not be eligible to use the streamlined procedures. Taxpayers under examination may consult with their agent. Similarly, a taxpayer under criminal investigation by IRS Criminal Investigation is also ineligible to use the streamlined procedures."<ref name=irs-sfcp/>

===Streamlined filing does not absolve taxpayers of previous penalty assessments===

Taxpayers who have previously engaged in "quiet disclosure", such as amending returns or filing delinquent returns to include information on assets and income, may still use streamlined. However, previous penalties that ''have already been assessed'' are not waived by streamlined filing.<ref name=irs-sfcp/>

===Relationship with the Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program (OVDP)===

The Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program (OVDP) is a now-closed program (it closed on September 28, 2018) that played a similar role to the streamlined filing compliance procedures. Any taxpayer who submitted a voluntary disclosure letter under OVDP on or after July 1, 2014 is not eligible to participate in the streamlined filing compliance procedures. Taxpayers who submitted a voluntary disclosure letter under OVDP (or any predecessor program) prior to July 1, 2014, but who does not yet have a fully executed OVDP closing agreement, may request treatment under the applicable penalty terms available under the streamlined procedures.<ref name=irs-sfcp/>

==Alternatives==

===Quiet disclosure===

Quiet disclosure refers to taxpayers disclosing without going through the streamlined procedures or any other official program for disclosing past noncompliance.<ref name=irs-sfcp/><ref name=golding-quiet-disclosure>{{cite web|url = https://www.goldinglawyers.com/irs-quiet-disclosure/|title = 10 Reasons to Avoid IRS Quiet Disclosure (New)|accessdate = June 29, 2024|publisher = Golding Lawyers}}</ref><ref name=freeman-quiet-disclosure>{{cite web|url = https://freemanlaw.com/the-danger-of-a-quiet-disclosure/|title = The Danger of a Quiet Disclosure|accessdate = June 29, 2024|publisher = Freeman Law}}</ref> This could include:

* Starting the reporting of assets and income going forward, without reporting it for past years
* Filing delinquent or amended returns for prior years including some or all previously omitted information on foreign assets and income, but without explicitly going through a disclosure program.

Quiet disclosure is discouaged by the IRS as well as by tax lawyers, who encourage using the streamlined procedures wherever possible, to stay compliant and reduce the risk of draconian penalties and audits.<ref name=golding-quiet-disclosure/><ref name=freeman-quiet-disclosure/>

==Effect on taxes, interest, and penalties==

===Streamlined filing does not reduce taxes or interest on taxes===

Even with a streamlined filing, any taxes that were due are still owed by the taxpayer. Moreover, if the taxes are past the filing deadline for taxes, interest on these taxes is also due.

The lookback period for streamlined filing for tax returns is three years, which matches the IRS lookback period for auditing (the IRS can audit tax returns up to three years old, though it may under limited circumstances audit tax returns that are older).<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/resources/business-law-today/2017-august/irs-can-audit-for-three-years/|title = IRS Can Audit for Three Years, Six, or Forever: Here's How to Tell|last = Wood|first = Robert W.|date = August 15, 2017|accessdate = June 29, 2024|publisher = American Bar Association}}</ref> So, in practice, in most cases, only taxes due for the past three years matter, and the streamlined procedures already cover these taxes.

===Properly done streamlined filing (both foreign and domestic) eliminates many penalties that may otherwise apply===

Eligible taxpayers who do a proper streamlined filing eliminate many penalties that may otherwise apply: failure-to-file penalty, failure-to-pay penalty, accuracy-related penalty, information return penalties (for failure to include required information returns such as Forms 3520, 5471, and 8938 with their tax returns) and FBAR penalties (for failure to file or inaccuracies). This includes penalties for years prior to the years covered by the streamlined filing i(if not assessed already); in particular, if the taxpayer fully catches up with FBAR for the past 6 years and with information returns and tax reporting for the past 3 years, the taxpayer will no longer have to pay the FBAR penalty or information return penalties not just for those past years but for prior years as well, if such penalties have not already been assessed.<ref name=irs-sfop/><ref name=irs-sdop/>

===5% miscellaneous offshore penalty in the domestic case==

The Streamlined Domestic Offshore Procedures include a 5% miscellaneou offshore penalty on the end-of-year balance for assets for which one of these is true:<ref name=irs-sdop/><ref name=irs-sdo-faq/>

* not reported on the FBAR ([[FinCEN Form 114]]) (in any year over the past 6 years)
* not report on [[Form 8938]] (in any year over the past 3 years)
* income (such as interest and dividend income) from the asset not reported in the tax return (in any year over the past 3 years)

For each year, the total value of foreign financial assets subject to the penalty is calculated, then the maximum of the values across all years is taken; the penalty is 5% of this amount. The calculations are done as part of Form 14654.<ref name=f14654/><ref name=sdo-faq>
