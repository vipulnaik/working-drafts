== History ==

Some CCD records date back to the mid-1990s. Since February 2001, CCD has stored photographs of all visa applicants in electronic form. Since 2007, CCD has been storing ten-print scans.<ref name=crs/> In 2009, the number of visa cases in the CCD were over 100 million, and there were 75 million photographs.<ref name=crs/> In 2016, an ''[[ABC News]]'' report mentioned that CCD had 290 million passport records, 184 million visa records, and 25 million records of U.S. citizens living overseas.<ref name=crs/>{{rp|6}}

On July 20, 2014, after a software update, CCD started having significant performance issues. On July 23, CCD was brought back online with limited capacity. The Department of State worked with Microsoft and Oracle to restore the old level of performance. Due to issues with CCD, visa caseload processing was slowed down.<ref name=ccd-issues/>

The most recent [[Privacy Impact Assessment]] of CCD was completed on July 17, 2015.<ref name=pia/> A [[Congressional Research Service]] report about visa issuances, published November 18, 2015, discussed the CCD at some length.<ref name=crs/>

In April 2016, it was revealed that an internal review by the U.S. Department of State of its cyber-defenses had found that CCD was at risk of being compromised, though no breach had been detected.<ref name=abc/><ref name=securityaffairs/>
