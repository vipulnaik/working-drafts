'''Timed comments''' are a feature offered by some audio and video players and websites where people can add comments associated with specific times in an audio or video.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nickdiakopoulos.com/2007/07/19/time-comments-in-video/|title = Timed Comments in Video|date = July 19, 2007|accessdate = April 28, 2019|last = Diakopoulos|first = Nick}}</ref> These comments are then displayed in the player when that time is reached while playing the audio or video.

Timed comments differ from annotations, captions, and subtitles in an important respect: they can be added by viewers, not just video creators, and they include the identity of the person adding the comment.

== Examples ==

* [[SoundCloud]], an audio distribution platform and music sharing website: Timed comments can be added at a specific minute and second mark in a soundtrack, and are displayed when the track reaches that minute and second mark. Users can see each others' comments.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.speedofcreativity.org/2011/09/19/share-timed-comments-on-audio-recordings-with-soundcloud-playingwithmedia/|title = Share “timed” comments on Audio Recordings with SoundCloud|last = Fryer|first = Wesley|date = September 19, 2011|accessdate = April 28, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.stevelawson.net/2010/03/annotating-tracks-with-soundcloud/|title = Annotating Tracks With Soundcloud|date = March 20, 2010|accessdate = April 28, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/15/vusay-video/|title = Vusay Keeps Eyeballs Glued By Adding SoundCloudy Timed Comments To Any Video|last = Constine|first = Josh|date = October 15, 2014|accessdate = April 28, 2019|publisher = TechCrunch}}</ref><ref name=viki-revives-timed-comments/>
