== Background and case ==

=== Petitioner's background ===

Poghos Kazarian grew up in [[Armenia]]. He received a Ph.D in Theoretical Physics from [[Yerevan State University]] in [[Yerevan]], Armenia in 1997. From 1997 to 2000, he remained at YSU as a Research Associate, where he specialized in non-Einsteinian theories of gravitation. From 2000 to 2004, he worked as a Physics/Math/Programming Tutor,  an  Adjunct  Physics  and  Mathematics Instructor, and a Science Lecture Series speaker at [[Glendale Community College (California)|Glendale Community College]], [[California]], in the [[United States]]. He was also a member of a research group at the [[California Institute of Technology]], located close to Glendale Community College, where he worked with American theoretical physicist [[Kip Thorne]]. He also authored the self-published textbook ''Concepts in Physics: Classical Mechanics''. He published in journals such as ''[[Astrophysics (journal)|Astrophysics]]'' and worked on [[cosmogony]] problems posed by [[Victor Ambartsumian]].<ref name=nafsa/><ref name=aao-decision>{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/err/B2%20-%20Aliens%20with%20Extraordinary%20Ability/Decisions_Issued_in_2006/Sep282006_01B2203.pdf|title = WAC 04 064 51500 USCIS Administrative Appeals Office decision on Matter of Kazarian|date = September 28, 2006|accessdate = December 26, 2016|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}</ref>

Kazarian's time in the United States was spent on a visitor visa ([[B visa]]) that precludes formal employment. His teaching and tutoring work were carried out in a volunteer capacity, though he did earn some income as reported on a [[Form 1040]]. Although he was listed as working at YSU till 2000, his immigration documentation shows that he had been in the United States in visitor status since October 1998.<ref name=aao-decision/><ref name=nafsa/>

=== EB-1 petition ===
															   
On December 31, 2003, at the age of 34, Kazarian submitted a [[Form I-140]] petition for [[EB-1 visa|EB-1 status]].<ref name=nafsa/> Kazarian's petition was filed by the lawyer George Verdin.<ref name=nafsa/><ref name=hirsch/> Verdin had been disbarred from law practice in the state of [[Hawaii]] in 1999 and placed on the [[Executive Office for Immigration Review]]'s [[List of Currently Disciplined Practitioners]] in 2000.<ref name=eoir-disciplining>{{cite web|url = https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2014/02/03/VerdinGeorgeA_ImmSuspension.pdf|title = Decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals|date = December 4, 2000|accessdate = December 27, 2016}}</ref> Verdin's history as a lawyer would be referenced in later discussions of the appropriateness of the petition category and evidence submitted.<ref name=nafsa/><ref name=hirsch/>

The petition included support for the following pieces of evidence that were used to justify eligibility for EB-1 status; at least three pieces of evidence must be matched in order to qualify for the EB-1:<ref name=aao-decision/>

* Evidence of receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence: 
** A medal for high school graduation with honors by the Ministry of Education of Armenia. The petitioner included a caption stating that the medal was awarded for "success in studies, labor and for the exemplary behavior."
** A letter from the Dean of the Physics Department at YSU stating that the petitioner "was awarded by the Dean's Honor for Excellence in Study During 5 Years (1989 to 1994)."
** Selection for [[Marquis Who's Who]].
* Documentation of the alien's membership in associations in the field for which classification is sought, which require outstanding achievements of their members, as judged by recognized national or international experts in their disciplines or fields.
** Solicitation to join the [[American Chemical Society]]
** Solicitation to join the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]
** Membership in the [[New York Academy of Sciences]]
* Published materials about the alien in professional or major trade publications or other major media, relating to the alien's work in the field for which classification is sought. Such evidence shall include the title, date, and author of the material, and any necessary translation.
** An article, "The Young Talent from America", that the petitioner said was published in the Armenian magazine ''Louys'', that he contended was the nation's largest weekly publication.
** An article about the petitioner's immigration troubles, published in an unidentified newspaper.
** A television interview regarding his professional activities to the Armenian National Network.
* Evidence of the alien's participation, either individually or on a panel, as a judge of the work of others in the same or an allied field of specification for which classification is sought.
** A letter from Professor Chubarian, the Head of the Department of Theoretical Physics at YSU stating that the petitioner was involved in teaching activities and reviewing diploma works.
* Evidence of the alien's original scientific, scholarly, artistic, athletic, or business-related contributions of major significance in the field.
** Letters from prominent scientists at the [[California Institute of Technology]], including [[Kip Thorne]], as well as from Paolo Pirjanian of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.<ref name=aao-decision/><ref name=nafsa/>
** Letters from colleagues at Glendale Community College
** Letters from people at YSU who knew the petitioner while he was there
* Evidence of the alien's authorship of scholarly articles in the field, in professional or major trade publications or other major media.
** Published articles by the petitioners in various physics journals, such as ''[[Astrophysics (journal)|Astrophysics]]''
** A self-published book, ''Concepts in Physics: Classical Mechanics'', with reviews by colleagues at Glendale Community College, who said the college was considering using the abook as a text.

Below are the remaining types of evidence that can be considered for an EB-1 application, but that were of less relevane to the petition:

* Evidence of the display of the alien's work in the field at artistic exhibitions or in showcases: The later appeal would claim that the petitioner's self-published book, community college lectures, and conference presentations met this criterion.
* Evidence that the alien has performed in a leading or critical role for organizations: No claims were made for this line of evidence.
* Evidence that the alien has commanded a high salary or other significantly high remuneration for services, in relation to others in the field. The petitioner submitted a [[Form 1040]] tax return for 2004 showing $4,765 in wages, but no claims were made about this being unusually high remuneration.
* Evidence of commercial success in the performing arts, as shown by box office receipts or record, cassette, compact disk, or video sales: The later appeal would claim that the petitioner's self-published book, that would be considered by Glendale Community College as a text, would qualify due to the potential for high sales.

=== Denial of the petition and of the appeal ===

In August 2005, Kazarian's Form I-140 EB-1 petition was denied by the USCIS California Service Center.<ref name=nafsa/> Kazarian appealed the denial (specify lawyer used to appeal). The USCIS [[Administrative Appeals Office]] (AAO) dismissed the appeal on September 28, 2006. The case as decided by the AAO is referred to as ''Matter of Kazarian'', consistent with the USCIS' naming of appeal cases.<ref name=aao-decision/>

The AAO concurred with the reasoning offered by the California Service Center for denial, and provided additional elaboration on some points. The AAO's decision did not admit any of the lines of evidence that the petitioner had used, noting that they either did not apply or fell far short of the level needed for EB-1 status. Below is a summary of AAO's reasons for rejecting the various lines of evidence that were seriously considered:<ref name=aao-decision/>

* Evidence of receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence: AAO argued that the prizes were not tied to the petitioner's professional achievements but achieved at a younger age. It also noted the lack of evidence for these being indicators of significant accomplishment.
* Documentation of the alien's membership in associations in the field for which classification is sought, which require outstanding achievements of their members, as judged by recognized national or international experts in their disciplines or fields: The AAO noted that the petitioner had not submitted evidence of membership in these organizations being exclusive, that many of them had fairly large memberships, and that one of them was not even in the petitioner's profession.
* Published materials about the alien in professional or major trade publications or other major media, relating to the alien's work in the field for which classification is sought. Such evidence shall include the title, date, and author of the material, and any necessary translation: The AAO noted that the copies of articles submitted did not clearly include the name of the publication, and that corroborating information for the claims of circulation were not provided. Further, one of the articles were not even about the petitioner's professional work, and no clear evidence was provided about the television appearance.
* Evidence of the alien's original scientific, scholarly, artistic, athletic, or business-related contributions of major significance in the field: The AAO noted that most of the letters were by colleagues rather than unaffiliated people, and did not offer sufficiently specific examples of the impact that Kazarian's work had had. Even the review by Thorne, it noted, only placed Kazarian at the level of a "young professor at a strong, research-oriented university in the United States" and this was deemed to not meet the standard needed for the EB-1. The AAO also noted that the self-published book had no ISBN and no evidence of adoption so far, did not constitute sufficient evidence as of the time of the petition.
*  Evidence of the alien's authorship of scholarly articles in the field, in professional or major trade publications or other major media: The AAO noted that Kazarian's academic output matched that expected of post-doctoral fellows, and that no evidence had been submitted to show that it was substantially above that standard.
 
=== Court case ===

Having exhausted administrative remedies provided within the immigration bureaucracy, Kazarian filed a complaint with the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]].<ref name=nafsa/> The USCIS filed a motion for summary judgment, and the judge [[Manuel Real]] granted the motion.<ref name=nafsa/> Kazarian timely appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]].<ref name=nafsa/>

The case was argued and submitted on December 9, 2008. An initial opinion and dissent were filed on September 4, 2009.<ref name=nafsa/> The initial opinion upheld the USCIS and AAO's decision completely. In response, [[Bernard Wolfsdorf]], an immigration lawyer who has served as President of the [[American Immigration Lawyers Association]], sought review of the decision. According to immigration lawyer Cyrus D. Mehta, who informally helped with brainstorming, says that the purpose of seeking review was not to overturn the decision in its entirety but to discredit some of the AAO's reasoning.<ref name=mehta>{{Cite web|url = http://www.ilw.com/articles/2010,0414-mehta.shtm|title = Kazarian V. USCIS: Discrediting The Circularity Argument In EB-1 Petitions|last = Mehta|first = Cyrus|date = April 14, 2010|accessdate = December 27, 2016|publisher = [[Immigration Daily]]}}</ref>

The decision was filed on March 4, 2010. The opinion was delivered by the judge [[Dorothy Wright Nelson]], with concurrence by [[Harry Pregerson]].<ref name=nafsa/> Although the decision was against the petitioner, the arguments included in the court's opinion were considered a victory by immigration lawyers at the time, accomplishing the purpose sought by the push to seek review.<ref name=mehta/>

==== Opinion of the court (by Nelson) ====

The court noted that the AAO had concluded that Kazarian had provided evidence for zero of the ten types of evidence (compared to the minimum requirement of three). However, the court argued that for two of the ten types of evidence, Kazarian had provided enough initial evidence and the AAO's grounds for rejecting the evidence were based on a misinterpretation of the regulations. The two lines of evidence where the court said that AAO had erred were:<ref name=nafsa/>

* Authorship of scholarly articles in the field of endeavor: The court noted that "Nothing in that provision requires a petitioner to demonstrate the research community's reaction to his published articles before those articles can be considered as evidence, and neither USCIS nor an AAO may impose novel evidentiary requirements beyond those set forth."
* Participation as a judge of the work of others: The court noted that "Nothing in that provision suggests that whether judging university dissertations counts as evidence turns on which university the judge is affiliated with."

In the process of elaborating on its reasoning, the court proposed a two-step process, as follows:<ref name=nafsa/>

* The first step should focus on counting the number of lines of evidence for which evidence was presented as required by the regulations. If the number of lines of evidence that passed through the first step was less than three, the petition could be rejected directly, without detailed examination.
* The second step, a "final merits determination", was subjecting the evidence to critical scrutiny. If they held up to critical scrutiny, the petition would be accepted. At this stage, additional evidence could be sought from the petitioner.

The court held that the AAO had held by imposing additional evidentiary requirements. However, since this error was made on only two of the ten lines of evidence, and the petition should have been rejected anyway, the error was "harmless": it did not materially affect the adjudication.<ref name=nafsa/>

==== Concurrence (by Pregerson) ====

Pregerson, while concurring with Nelson's opinion, noted that Kazarian would have been an excellent candidate for the [[EB-2 visa]] (exceptional ability) and that it was a mistake on the part of his lawyer to suggest he apply for the EB-1. This was consistent with the fact that Kazarian's original lawyer, George Verdin, was on the [[List of Currently Disciplined Practitioners]] maintained by the [[Executive Office for Immigration Review]].<ref name=nafsa/><ref name=hirsch/>
