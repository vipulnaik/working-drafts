'''''Kazarian v. USCIS''''' refers to a case decided by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] on March 4, 2010, pertaining to a USCIS decision on a [[Form I-140]] [[EB-1 visa|EB-1 application]].<ref name=nafsa>{{cite web|url = https://www.nafsa.org/uploadedFiles/kazariandecision.pdf|title = ''Kazarian v. USCIS'' Order and Opinion|publisher = [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]|accessdate = December 26, 2016}}</ref> The decision led the USCIS to issue a policy memo (dated August 18, 2010) change its adjudication process for EB-1 and EB-2 petitions to a "two-step review" where the first step would focus on counting pieces of evidence and the second step would involve a merits determination. The case has been cited by USCIS as well as by petitioners in hundreds of Form I-140 petitions and appeals since 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=uscis-aao&commit=Search&page=1&query=kazarian&utf8=âœ“|title = AAO Non-Precedent Decision Search for Kazarian|accessdate = December 26, 2016|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}</ref>

==Background==

=== Petitioner's background ===

Poghos Kazarian grew up in [[Armenia]]. He received a Ph.D in Theoretical Physics from [[Yerevan State University]] in Yerevan, Armenia in 1997. From 1997 to 2000, he remained at YSU as a Research Associate, where he specialized in non-Einsteinian theories of gravitation. From 2000 to 2004, he worked as a Physics/Math/Programming  Tutor,  an  Adjunct  Physics  and  Mathematics Instructor, and a Science Lecture Series speaker at [[Glendale Community College (California)|Glendale Community College]], [[California]], in the [[United States]]. He was also a member of a research group at the [[California Institute of Technology]], located close to Glendale Community College, where he worked with American theoretical physicist [[Kip Thorne]]. He also authored the self-published textbook ''Concepts in Physics: Classical Mechanics''. He published in journals such as ''[[Astrophysics (journal)|Astrophysics]]'' and worked on [[cosmogony]] problems posed by [[Victor Ambartsumian]].<ref name=nafsa/><ref name=aao-decision>{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/err/B2%20-%20Aliens%20with%20Extraordinary%20Ability/Decisions_Issued_in_2006/Sep282006_01B2203.pdf|title = WAC 04 064 51500 USCIS Administrative Appeals Office decision on Matter of Kazarian|date = September 28, 2006|accessdate = December 26, 2016|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}</ref>

Kazarian's time in the United States was spent on a visitor visa ([[B visa]]) that precludes formal employment. His teaching and tutoring work were carried out in a volunteer capacity. Although he was listed as working at YSU till 2000, his immigration documentation shows that he had been in the United States in visitor status since October 1998.<ref name=aao-decision/><ref name=nafsa/>
