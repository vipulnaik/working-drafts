== History ==

In August 1994, Berks County started renting out detention center space at its youth detention center to the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (INS), the predecessor to ICE, to house juvenile immigration detainees. An article about the subject quoted Theodore Nordmark, assistant director of the INS, noting that the location of the detention center was convenient for him from his Philadelphia office, and suggested the convenient location was one reason for choosing Berks County.<ref name=ldnews/> The housing of detainees was estimated by the county to be profitable, even after accounting for their education expenses.<ref name=ldnews/> By May 3, 2000, constructing of a new building was planned, and Berks County was in discussions with INS to house families.<ref name=ldnews/> On March 3, 2001, the Berks County Residential Center opened for use by INS for [[family immigration detention in the United States|family immigration detention]].<ref name=ldnews/><ref name=billypenn/><ref name=readingeagle/>

In January 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services Services (PA DHS) issued notice that the licensing of the Berks County Residential Center to operate as a child detention facility is being revoked and will not be renewed.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://services.dpw.state.pa.us/Resources/Documents/Pdf/ViolationReports/20160128_14386.pdf|title = The Department of Human Services is not renewing the certificate of compliance issued to the Berks County Commissioners to operate the Berks County Residential Center as a child residential facility|date = January 27, 2016|accessdate = July 4, 2021|publisher = Pennsylvania Department of Human Services}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://www2.law.temple.edu/csj/publication/pennsylvanias-legal-authority-shut-berks-family-detention-center/|title = Pennsylvania’s legal authority to shut down Berks Family Detention Center|date = October 31, 2017|accessdate = July 4, 2021|publisher = Center for Social Justice, Temple University Beasley School of Law}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.readingeagle.com/2016/01/30/state-wont-renew-license-of-berks-county-residential-center/|title = State won’t renew license of Berks County Residential Center|date = January 30, 2016|accessdate = December 18, 2021|publisher = Reading Eagle}}</ref> The decision was appealed in February;<ref>{{cite web|url = http://services.dpw.state.pa.us/Resources/Documents/Pdf/ViolationReports/20160211_14386.pdf|title = This is to acknowledge receipt of your request to appeal the Department's decision to NON-RENEW and REVOKE the license for Berks County Residential Center.|date = February 8, 2016|accessdate = July 4, 2021|publisher = Pennsylvania Department of Human Services}}</ref> PA DHS would issue reports of violations to the Berks County Residential Center in the years from 2016 to 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://services.dpw.state.pa.us/dhs/ViolationReport.aspx?reportid=14386&fac=BERKS%20COUNTY%20RESIDENTIAL%20CENTER#.WywNLlOUuRu|title = Inspection/Violation Reports for BERKS COUNTY RESIDENTIAL CENTER|accessdate = July 4, 2021|publisher = Pennsylvania Department of Human Services}}</ref>

In March 2021, ICE announced that no families were being detaineed at the Berks County Residential Center, and that the detention center will no longer be used for family detention. There were plans to repurpose it for adult detention.<ref name=post-gazette/><ref name=nbcphil/> Later in the month, a lawsuit was filed by the Sheller Center for Social Justice at Temple University Law School against Berks County commissioners Christian Leinbach, Kevin Barnhardt, and Michael Rivera, claiming that Berks County commissioners have been talking to ICE about converting the facility into an immigrant women’s prison but have refused to make any material public.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.inquirer.com/news/berks-immigrant-family-detention-center-ice-deportation-immigration-lawsuit-20210330.html|title = Immigration activists sue Berks commissioners to learn plans for ICE detention center.

== Controversy ==

The Berks County detention center has been the subject of repeated controversy and criticism.

In 2016, a former guard at the Berks County Residential Center pled guilty to and was sentenced for repeatedly sexually assaulting a 19-year-old detainee from [[Honduras]] in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.readingeagle.com/2016/04/15/west-reading-man-sentenced-for-sex-with-detainee/|title = West Reading man sentenced for sex with detainee|last = Weaver|first = Stephanie|date = April 15, 2016|accessdate = December 18, 2021|publisher = Reading Eagle}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://immigrationimpact.com/2016/04/15/berks-detention-center-employee-convicted-sexual-assault-young-honduran-mother/|title = Berks Detention Center Employee Convicted of Sexual Assault of Young Honduran Mother|last = Harris|first = Lindsay|date = April 15, 2016|accessdate = December 18, 2021|publisher = Immigration Impact}}</ref> In January 2020, Berks County settled, for $75,000, a related lawsuit brought by the victim against it for allowing the assault to happen.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.mcall.com/news/pennsylvania/mc-nws-pa-berks-family-center-immigration-rape-trial-20200123-foju57hsvff43gwzmqhna2l7xu-story.html|title = Berks County will pay $75,000 to refugee who says she was sexually assaulted by worker at immigration center|last = Hall|first = Peter|date = January 23, 2020|accessdate = December 18, 2021|publisher = The Morning Call}}</ref>

In August 2016, 22 female detainees (a group calling themselves "Madres de Berks") at Berks County Residential Center went on hunger strike to protest the length and conditions of their detention. Their statement says that they have been detained for 270 to 365 days, well above the "20 days or less" that then-DHS Secretary [[Jeh Johnson]] claimed is the average length of stay in family detention.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/08/12/mothers-to-homeland-security-we-wont-eat-until-we-have-asylum/|title = Mothers to Homeland Security: We Won’t Eat Until We Are Released|author = Madres de Berks|date = August 12, 2016|accessdate = December 18, 2021|publisher = New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://immigrationimpact.com/2016/08/15/mothers-hunger-strike-berks-family-detention-facility/|title = Why 22 Mothers Are On a Hunger Strike at the Berks Family Detention Facility|last = Feliz|first = Wendy|date = August 15, 2016|accessdate = December 18, 2021|publisher = Immigration Impact}}</ref>
