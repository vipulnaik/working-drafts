== Background ==

In 1848, the [[Mexican–American War]] concluded and Alta California (that includes the modern U.S. state of California, plus nearby regions) became part of the United States. At around the same time, gold was discovered in California, leading to an influx of miners into California, both from within the United States, and from other regions, primarily China and Latin America (including Mexico and Guatemala).<ref>{{cite book |last= Ward |first= Geoffrey |title= ''The West: An Illustrated History'' |publisher= Little, Brown & Co |year= 1997||isbn= 0-316-92236-6}}</ref>{{rp|147}}

The competition from foreign miners would lead to resentment among the white miners, leading to calls to limit foreign competition in mining.

On December 20, 1849, [[Peter Hardeman Burnett]] became the first Governor of the state of California.<ref name=burnett-bio>{{cite web|url = http://governors.library.ca.gov/01-Burnett.html|title = Peter Burnett 1849–1851|publisher = The Governor's Gallery, State of California|accessdate = June 24, 2017}}</ref> Burnett was a proponent of the state's exclusionary policies towards foreign miners, and in particular Chinese ones.

== Response and repeal ==

On May 19, 1850, a group of mostly Mexican and Peruvian miners, led by two French miners, protested against the tax.<ref name=us-labor-history/>{{rp|468}}<ref name=driven-out/>{{rp|50}}

The Act failed to raise the expected revenues and caused impoverishment among miners, leading to many of them fleeing to cities.<ref name=chinhate/> Landowners in Tuolomne County were concerned about the drop in rents and prices as miners left the area in response to the high taxes, and therefore lobbied for the repeal of the tax.<ref name=us-labor-history/>{{rp|468}}

On January 9, 1851, [[John McDougall (California politician)|John McDougall]] (sometimes spelled John McDougal) succeeded Peter Burnett as California governor.<ref name=mcdougall-bio>{{cite web|url = http://governors.library.ca.gov/02-Mcdougal.html|title = John McDougal 1851–1852|publisher = The Governors' Gallery, State of California|accessdate = June 24, 2017}}</ref> Unlike his predecessor and successor, McDougall has a favorable view of Chinese immigration, and sees it as a way to cope with California's labor shortage, proposing to employ Chinese immigrants in projects to reclaim swamps and flooded lands.<ref name=nps/> Under McDougall's governorship, the Act was repealed.
