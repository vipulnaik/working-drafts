''USCIS Service Centers''' are centers under the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] where Immigration Service Officers (ISOs) perform activities related to petitions and application forms, including adjudication and readjudication of petitions and other application processing, as well as other customer service and backend processing functions.

Unlike USCIS Field Offices, Service Centers do not have walk-in facilities: all communication with them happens through the mail and (to a limited extent) by phone or electronically.
