'''Form DS-160''' is a form of the [[U.S. Department of State]] that needs to be filled in by all nonimmigrant visa applicants to the [[United States]] as part of their nonimmigrant visa application process.<ref name=ds-160-canonical>{{cite web|url = https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/forms/ds-160-online-nonimmigrant-visa-application.html|title = DS-160: Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application|accessdate = March 3, 2024|publisher = [[U.S. Department of State]]}}</ref> The form supersedes and replaces several other forms such as DS-156, DS-157, DS-158, and DS-3032, that were previously used for some kinds of nonimmigrant visa applications, so that now all nonimmigrant visa applications must use Form DS-160. The majority of nonimmigrant visa applicants do not need to complete any other Department of State form as part of the application process, though some E visa applicants may need to complete an additional form (DS-156E).<ref name=ds-160-faqs>{{cite web|url = https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/forms/ds-160-online-nonimmigrant-visa-application/ds-160-faqs.html|title = DS-160: Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate = March 3, 2024|publisher = [[U.S. Department of State]]}}</ref>

==Filling and submission of the form==

The DS-160 must be filled and submitted electronically via the website of the Consular Electronic Application Center (CEAC), a part of the U.S. Department of State.<ref name=ds-160-canonical/><ref name=ds-160-online>{{cite web|url = https://ceac.state.gov/genniv/|title = Apply For a Nonimmigrant Visa|accessdate = March 3, 2024}}</ref> The online form allows for retrieval and editing of an existing application based on the application number as well as some applicant details, so that the whole application does not need to be filled in one session. Applications that were closed before those initial details were entered are not retrievable and a new application must be started. Unsubmitted applications are deleted after 30 consecutive days of inactivity (not 30 days after initial creation, but only if there is a gap of 30 days since the last retrieval).<ref name=ds-160-online/>

There is no fee for submitting a DS-160. Once submitted, a DS-160 application cannot be edited; however, if the submitted DS-160 has errors, a new DS-160 can be started with corrected information, and the application ID for the new DS-160 can be used for the visa application.

==Significance for visa interview==

===Inclusion of application ID===

Embassies and consulates, or the online systems that they use for booking visa appointments, will generally ask for the DS-160 number as part of the process of booking an appointment for a visa interview (or document drop-off via the [[Interview Waiver Program]])). The DS-160 confirmation page (not the full application, just the confirmation page), with a scannable barcode, is one of the documents that the applicant is expected to carry for the visa interview or document drop-off location.

While the advice offered by the U.S. Department of State is to submit the DS-160 before ''booking'' the visa appointment,<ref name=ds-160-faqs/> it may be possible to submit an application for a visa interview (or document drop-off) with the application ID of a DS-160 that has not yet been submitted, and make sure to submit the DS-160 prior to the actual interview and then carry the DS-160 confirmation printout to the interview.

If the DS-160 whose application ID was included when booking the interview is problematic (for instance, the applicant notices some mistakes, or the applicant fails to submit or loses access to the DS-160) it ''may'' be possible (depending on the embassy or consulate, as well as other information specific to the application) to fill in a new DS-160 and request the embassy or consulate to change the DS-160 application ID associated with the visa application before the actual interview. <ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvS1lhwpXyE|title = Escape US Visa Interview Rejection by Avoiding Mistakes in DS160: How to Correct if submitted DS160|author = Salman|publisher = YouTube|date = June 8, 2023|accessdate = March 3, 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P_AMohUnFM|title = How to Correct Mistakes in DS160 form after you have submitted it|last = Mall|first = Shachi|date = March 27, 2021|accessdate = March 3, 2024|publisher = YouTube}}</ref>

===Use in adjudication process===

The DS-160 is one of the few documents that are always reviewed by consular officers as part of the adjudication process for visas. For in-person interviews, the consular officer pulls up the DS-160 on screen and references it during the visa interview.<ref name=ds-160-secrets>{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIGQxDDnPZI|title = DS-160 Secrets from a Former Visa Officer|publisher = Argo Visa|date = May 16, 2023|accessdate = March 3, 2024}}</ref> Most other documents are not directly reviewed by the consular officers,<ref>{{cite web|url = https://in.usembassy.gov/visas/nonimmigrant-visas/|title = Nonimmigrant Visas|accessdate = March 3, 2024}}</ref>{{pp|From "Frequently Asked Questions" section: "Applying for a non-immigrant visa is not a documentary process."}} hence the DS-160 has been considered one of the most important documents to fill carefully.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1gXGS92-I0|title = Why won't the Visa Officer look at your documents?|publisher = ZF Visa & Immigration|date = April 24, 2023|accessdate = March 3, 2024}}</ref> raising the relative importance of the DS-160. Ways that the DS-160 could be significant for the adjudication process include:

* Inconsistencies between data entered in the DS-160 and the applicant's answers in the interview process may raise red flags.
* Information that the consular officer can access through electronic systems, that the applicant should have filled in the DS-160 but ''did not fill in the DS-160'', may raise red flags. For instance, if the applicant claims in the DS-160 to have never been refused a U.S. visa, but the [[Consular Consolidated Database]] shows a past refusal, this is a red flag that may lead to refusal if the applicant is not able to explain it.
* Incomplete work or educational history could raise red flags, that the applicant may need to clarify in the interview process.
* Inconsistencies in key biographical information (name, date of birth) between the DS-160 and passport could cause delays in adjudication.
