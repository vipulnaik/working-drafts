Shewing also that the Nation can bear the charge of Four Millions per Annum, when the occasions of the Government require it''.<ref name=power-of-gdp/>{{rp|30}} {{w|Willam Petty}} produces estimates of the income and expenditure, population, land, and other assets of England and Wales, in order to assess the country's resources to finance the Anglo-Dutch War through taxes. Based on these, he argues that more efficient use of the existing land, labor, and capital would allow England to outperform its competitors Holland and France. Petty also applies {{w|double-entry bookkeeping}} to keep national records.<ref name=gdp-brief-history>{{cite web|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/GDP.html?id=t7pKCAAAQBAJ|title = GDP: A Brief but Affectionate History|last = Coyle|first = Diane|accessdate = October 17, 2017}}</ref>{{rp|8}} He uses his work to argue that taxing income, and not just land, can be an effective way to raise government revenue.<ref name=power-of-gdp/>{{rp|32}} The document would be published posthumously in 1691.<ref name=power-of-gdp/>{{rp|30}} Petty's approach would be inspirational to Colin Clark, pioneering 20th century UK economic statistician.<ref name=power-of-gdp/>{{rp|42-43}} || United Kingdom || United Kingdom
|-
| 1676 || || || Petty publishes his second estimate of England's national income, in a document titled ''Political Arithmetick'', with subtitle ''The Extent of Value of Lands, People, Buildings. As the same relates to every Country in general, but more particularly to the Territories of His Majesty in Great Britain, and his neighbors of Holland and France''. This would be published posthumously in 1690. The document emphasizes the importance of building infrastructure, agricultural progress, and increase in trade and economic activity as ways to increase national income. Petty also argues that an improved tax system can lead to more revenue to finance a better military.<ref name=power-of-gdp/>{{rp|33-35}} || United Kingdom || United Kingdom

It does include population estimates, not clear what other estimates it includes that relate to modern economic statistics. || Sweden || Sweden
|-
| 1776 || || || In ''{{w|The Wealth of Nations}}'', economist {{w|Adam Smith}} argues that only the production of physical goods (both agriculture and industry) should be counted in national income, not the production of services. Smith's view would be the dominant view, taken further by {{w|Karl Marx}}, until being overtaken by the views of {{w|Alfred Marshall}}.<ref name=gdp-brief-history/>{{rp|22}}

|-
| 1930s || || || {{w|Colin Clark}}, an economic statistician at Cambridge University, publishes extensively on the United Kingdom's economic statistics, and  heralds the second phase of work on national income accounting. In 1930, Clark is appointed to provide statistics to the newly created National Economic Advisory Council, the first body ever created by the UK government to provide formal economic advice.<ref name=gdp-brief-history/>{{rp|25}} His first major work is ''National Income 1924-31'', published 1932. In addition to publishing data, Clark also lambasts the poor state of economic statistics, arguing for more standardization in industry classification and complaining about companies refusing to share profit information.<ref name=tily/>{{rp|343-346}} || United Kingdom || United Kingdom
|-

|-
| 1940 || || || The book ''{{w|How to Pay for the War: A Radical Plan for the Chancellor of the Exchequer}}'' by {{w|John Maynard Keynes}} is published. In the vein of similar 17th century works, it seeks to find ways to finance and justify the costs of a war that the United Kingdom is involved in, with Keynes relying heavily on the numbers published by Colin Clark in the 1930s. The book includes national income calculations that would prove influential in postwar economic statistics.<ref name=tily/>{{rp|347-349}}<ref name=power-of-gdp/>{{rp|48}} || United Kingdom || United Kingdom
|-
| 1940 || || || The book ''The Conditions of Economic Progress'' by Colin Clark is published. The culmination of several years of data gathering and effort, the book is the first large-scale international comparison of national accounts figures. The book also introduces the idea of the ''international unit'', an early version of purchasing power parity-type calculations, to compare different countries by controlling for the different prices there. Clark finds that per capita living standards in the United States and Canada are about 14 times those in the poorest nations, and concludes that the age of plenty for all is far away. Clark's figures would be influential in the growth of development aid to the poorest nations after World War II. Clark's data also shows that as an economy gets richer, its employment structure shifts from agriculture and industry to services. Angus Maddison, an economist who would spend several decades reconstructing historical economic estimates, would speak highly of Clark's work.<ref name=power-of-gdp/>{{rp|42-46}}<ref name=gdp-brief-history/>{{rp|65}} || ||

These two studies demonstrate the fact that there can be a considerable gap between the official exchange rates and purchasing power parities, and therefore the need for research on the computation of PPPs for different currencies. This has led to the eventual establishment of the International Comparison Project (ICP) at the University of Pennsylvania by Kravis, Heston, Summers and Kenessey. The work by Kravis et al. (1975 and 1978) was instrumental in establishing the procedures and guidelines for undertaking international comparisons. The report of Kravis, Heston and Summers (1982) on Phase III of the ICP, may be considered as a definitive account of the standard procedures of the ICP. The ICP had been upgraded subsequently from the status of a project to a program due to the increased coverage of more than 65 countries in Phase IV. The publication of the Handbook of the International Comparison Programme (UN, 1992), is another major source for the procedures recommended for use in international comparisons. There are several OECD publications, all with the title "Purchasing Power Parities and Real Expenditures" (OECD 1987, 1996 and 1999), that deal with procedures underlying PPP computation. Similar publications are regularly published by Eurostat.}}</ref><ref name=wapo-gilbert-obit>{{cite web|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1979/09/30/milton-gilbert-economist-authority-on-gold/a7983cbc-dba7-47ae-8e92-c2aa501e41ae/|title = Milton Gilbert, Economist, Authority on Gold|publisher = ''Washington Post''|date = September 30, 1979|accessdate = October 19, 2017}}</ref><ref name=aea-kravis-memoir/>{{rp|177–178}}<ref name=gdp-brief-history/>{{rp|65}}

==Meta information on the timeline==

===How the timeline was built===

The initial version of the timeline was written by [[User:Issa|Issa Rice]] and [[User:Vipul|Vipul Naik]].

{{funding info}} is available.

===What the timeline is still missing===

* Some stuff on Chinese GDP figures and official processes and question marks around it
* United States Census and United States Economic Census
* Japan statistics and censuses starting 1721 (?)
* some historical details of ICP at [https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/icp/ipc6_htm.htm]
* """Basic work on the need for purchasing power parities as currency conversion factors began with the seminal work of Gilbert and Kravis for the OEEC in 1954 and the subsequent work of Gilbert and Associates (1958). These two studies demonstrate the fact that there can be a considerable gap between the official exchange rates and purchasing power parities, and therefore the need for research on the computation of PPPs for different currencies. This has led to the eventual establishment of the International Comparison Project (ICP) at the University of Pennsylvania by Kravis, Heston, Summers and Kenessey. The work by Kravis et al. (1975 and 1978) was instrumental in establishing the procedures and guidelines for undertaking international comparisons. The report of Kravis, Heston and Summers (1982) on Phase III of the ICP, may be considered as a definitive account of the standard procedures of the ICP. The ICP had been upgraded subsequently from the status of a project to a program due to the increased coverage of more than 65 countries in Phase IV. The publication of the Handbook of the International Comparison Programme (UN, 1992), is another major source for the procedures recommended for use in international comparisons. There are several OECD publications, all with the title "Purchasing Power Parities and Real Expenditures" (OECD 1987, 1996 and 1999), that deal with procedures underlying PPP computation. Similar publications are regularly published by Eurostat.""" [https://www.oecd.org/std/prices-ppp/2424597.pdf]
* Add some events of the period when exchange rates were used directly: "Before PPPs became available, exchange rates were used to make international comparisons of GDP." [http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/728703/728974/FAQ-PPP.pdf/5a92e63b-1c73-4d15-8acd-f3e5e734cbf2] (p4) It would be good to document what sort of comparison programs/tables were produced before PPPs took off.
