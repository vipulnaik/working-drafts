==Meta information on the timeline==

===How the timeline was built===

The initial version of the timeline was written by [[User:Issa|Issa Rice]].

{{funding info}} is available.

===What the timeline is still missing===

* Greece 2006 GDP massaging and subsequent investigation, see https://www.ft.com/content/171aaa36-d8f1-11e0-aff1-00144feabdc0 and Coyle (gdp-brief-history)
* Nordhaus and Tobin 1972 work on including other things in GDP calculation like leisure, off-market work, etc. (from Wikipedia page on green GDP, go to citation)
* History of Human Development Index, specifically 1990 publication of Human Development Reports by Mahbub ul Haq. Also maybe 1968 speech by Haq that challenged GDP.
* More on green GDP
* Some stuff on Chinese GDP figures and official processes and question marks around it
* United States Census and United States Economic Census
* Japan statistics and censuses starting 1721 (?)

From Coyle:

* 1940: John Maynard Keys publishes ''How to Pay for the War''
* 1941: Austin Robinson commissiones Richard Stone and James Meade to publish national accounts and GDP for UK, numbers published in 1941

* Jan Tinbergen's work on GDP in the context of the Netherlands
* PARIS21
* 1996 Boskin Commission
* 1969: Material Product System (MPS), like SNA except it only focuses on material production. Used by communist countries.
* 1940: Colin Clark does the first work on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), a precursor to the International Comparison Project and the Penn World Table
* 2007: World Bank cuts estimates of China's real GDP in PPP terms by 40% and does similar downgrading of other countries as a result of 2005 International Comparison Program survey

When were specific concepts introduced

* Purchasing power parity (PPP)
* International Geary-Khamis dollar
* Chain-weighting
* Laspeyres (?)
* Penn effect and its cousins
