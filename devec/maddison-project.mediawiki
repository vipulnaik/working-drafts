{{economic statistics project}}

The '''Maddison Project''', also known as the '''Maddison Historical Statistics Project''', is a project to collate historical [[economic statistics]], such as [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]], GDP per capita, and labor productivity.<ref name=official-website>{{cite web|url = http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/maddison-project/home.htm|title = Maddison Project|accessdate = October 3, 2017}}</ref><ref name=ggdc-linking-page>{{cite web|url = http://www.rug.nl/ggdc/historicaldevelopment/maddison/|title = The Database|publisher = Groningen Growth and Development Centre|accessdate = October 3, 2017}}</ref><ref name=worldbank-long-era>{{cite web|url = http://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/end-long-era|title = The end of a long era|last = Milanović|first = Branko|authorlink = Branko Milanović|date = July 19, 2013|accessdate = October 3, 2017|publisher = [[World Bank]]}}</ref> It was launched in March 2010 to continue the work of the late economic historian [[Angus Maddison]].

This page describes the data and methods both produced by the explicit Maddison Project and produced by Angus Maddison before his death (since the Maddison Project is continuation of his work).

== Data description ==

=== Data dimensions and metrics ===

The data presented in the Maddison Project database is a partial function where:

* The inputs (the dimensions) are country and year.
* The metrics include:
** Population: Included in 
** Real GDP
** Real GDP per capita, expressed in 1990 international [[Geary–Khamis dollar]]s. For simplicity, we will refer to this as GDP per capita.

==== Year dimension ====

While calendar years are the finest granularity at which data is presented, not all calendar years have data. Here is a description of how the granularity changes over time. Note that we count an year is present if there is data for at least one country for that year.<ref name=maddison-project-2013-data/><ref name=angus-maddison-2010-data-vertical/>

{| class="wikitable sortable" border="1"
! Year range !! Data granularity for Maddison 2010 !! Data granularity for Maddison 2013
|-
| 2009 to 2010 || Not present || Every year
|-
| 1820 to 2008 || Every year || Every year
|-
| 1800 to 1819 || Not present || Every year
|-
| 1700 to 1799 || 1700 (only one year) || 1700, 1725, 1750, 1775
|-
| 1400 to 1699 || 1400, 1500, 1600 (once every 100 years) || 1400, 1450, 1500, 1550, 1600, 1650 (once every 50 years)
|-
| Before 1400 || 1, 1000 || 1, 730, 1000 1150, 1280, 1300, 1348
|}

==== Country dimension ====

The country dimension includes most modern countries, but also includes historical countries (such as the former USSR) and regions within countries (such as centre-north Italy) for which it is easier to get historical data than their modern country equivalents. The working paper says:<ref name=maddison-project-2013-update/>

{{quotation|A related issue is that historical estimates often refer to different territorial entities than the countries within the borders of 1990, the basic unit of account used in the Maddison framework. He made many corrections for (minor) changes in borders (an overview will be provided in future work). However, moving back in time sometimes means that we have only estimates for Northern Italy (instead of Italy as a whole), for Holland (Netherlands) or for the Cape Colony (South Africa). When those smaller regions represented less than two-third of the population and/or the GDP of the modern country (within current borders), we have presented the estimates in italics to warn users.}}

In addition, data is also presented on aggregate regions (such as Western Europe) and the whole world. Data on aggregate regions and former countries is presented in bold.

==== Other information ====

As mentioned in connection with the country dimension, italics and bold are used for some cells.

Notes are added for some estimates, that are visible by hovering over the cell in spreadsheet software. A triangle at the top right of a cell indicates that there are notes for that cell.

Although the estimates ''should'' be color-coded (see [[#Accuracy and precision]]), this color-coding does not seem to show up in Google Sheets or Mac's Numbers software (it might show up only in Excel).

=== Caveats ===

==== Completeness ====

Data is not present for every combination of country and year. This could be because of the absence of reliable sources that could be used to construct the data.

Data on former countries continues to be calculated for years after that country ceases to exist as a geopolitical entity. 

==== Accuracy and precision ====

Data is fairly inaccurate and imprecise, with the accuracy and precision getting worse the farther back in time we go, and also varying significantly across geographical regions. However, the database does not provide error bars or any other explicit quantification of uncertainty. 

The working paper uses [[Steve Broadberry's classification of data sources]], listing four broad types of data sources in decreasing order of reliability, along with the color coding that should show up in the database.<ref name=maddison-project-2013-update/>{{rp|5}} Unfortunately, the color coding does not seem to show up in Mac's Numbers or in Google Sheets.<ref name=maddison-project-2013-data/>

==== Design decisions that might lead to systematic biases ====

Maybe something about the purchasing power parity marking China as too expensive?<ref name=maddison-right>{{cite web|url = http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/maddison-project/publications/wp7.pdf|title = What Makes Maddison Right?|author = Jan Luiten van Zanden|author2 = Debin Ma|date = September 1, 2017|accessdate = October 5, 2017}}</ref>
