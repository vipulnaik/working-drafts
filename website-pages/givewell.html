This page provides an overview of my history with charity evaluator <a href="https://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a>. I'm putting this up primarily as a reference point for people who come across my writings about GiveWell so that they can get a fuller context of my interaction with them. See also my page on the <a href="https://vipulnaik.com/open-philanthropy-project/">Open Philanthropy Project</a>. See also my <a href="https://vipulnaik.com/donation-history/">donation history page</a> and my <a href="https://vipulnaik.com/effective-altruism/">page about effective altruism</a>.

I keep drafts of some posts and comments related to GiveWell <a href="https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/tree/master/givewell">here</a>, but this folder may not include brief comments such as those made on open threads.

I have also made a number of predictions related to GiveWell on <a href="https://vipulnaik.com/predictionbook/">PredictionBook</a>, that you can scroll through on my <a href="https://predictionbook.com/users/vipulnaik">PredictionBook profile</a>. Unfortunately, their site search relies on Google, which is not reliable about indexing predictions, hence you'll have to manually go through my predictions to get a list of all GiveWell-related predictions.

Some of my past history:

<ul>
	<li>December 2009: I first examined the work of GiveWell. I believe the impetus was a <a href="https://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/24804">Bloggingheads diavlog between Peter Singer and William Easterly</a>. See also my <a href="https://vipulnaik.com/donation-history/">donation history page</a>.</li>
	<li>February or March 2010: I made a $2,000 donation to VillageReach, my first to the organization. See also my <a href="/donation-history/">donation history page</a>.</li>
	<li>Some time between August and November 2010: I had a phone conversation with one of the GiveWell staff (I vaguely remember it being Holden, but I could be mistaken). The main reason I believe that was the time  range is that I believe it happened either during or just before or after their <a href="https://www.givewell.org/international/site-visits/india-fall-2010">India site visit</a>.</li>
	<li>August 2011 (approximately): GiveWell made me an ombudsman. You can see the historical <a href="https://www.givewell.org/about/ombudsman-records">ombudsman records page</a>. You can also see my <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/givewell/conversations/topics/290">first email to the mailing list announcing myself as ombudsman</a> (see note at the bottom). The position has been deprecated for a while as of August 2016, though there was no specific date of deprecation.</li>
	<li>July and August 2011: In July 2011, I drafted a guest post for the GiveWell blog, describing my own history as a donor. The post was published in August 2011 on the GiveWell blog with the title <a href="https://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/05/guest-post-from-vipul-naik/">Guest post from Vipul Naik</a>.</li>
	<li>2011 and 2012: I participated somewhat in the GiveWell mailing list, and also sent occasional questions and suggestions about the website. In October 2012, I had a conversation with Holden Karnofsky about freedom of movement (inspired by him seeing me having started <a href="https://openborders.info"><em>Open Borders: The Case</em></a>; see <a href="https://vipulnaik.com/openborders/">my page about it</a>). The conversation wasn't recorded, though I did take some notes and send a follow-up email, but it was not intended for public circulation.</li>
	<li>March to May 2013: Jonah Sinick, who was then working at GiveWell, encouraged me to consider applying to GiveWell for after finishing my doctoral program. I talked briefly with Elie Hassenfeld about joining GiveWell. I was given a take-home assignment. However, I delayed a lot on finishing it. GiveWell had mentioned that they intend to hire three more people and are in no hurry to hire, hence I did not hurry. It turned out, however, that they were able to fill all three positions before I got around to turning in the assignment, so I was rejected. Jonah left GiveWell around the end of April 2013, at about the same time as I was rejected. Since working with Jonah was one of the main reasons for my interest, I did not press further with trying to join GiveWell (some people who have been initially rejected have succeeded on pressing further; I believe this could have been the case with me). Over time I feel it turned out for the better, as I was anyway delayed with finishing my Ph.D., and my career has taken a very different trajectory that I believe is more suitable for me (for more on my current trajectory, see my <a href="https://vipulnaik.com/job/">job</a> page).</li>
	<li>April 12, 2014: I published <a href="http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/k1n/evaluating_givewell_as_a_startup_idea_based_on/">Evaluating GiveWell as a startup idea based on Paul Graham's philosophy</a>, <em>LessWrong</em>.</li>
	<li>August 2014: I attended an in-person GiveWell research meeting at their San Francisco office. I did not participate actively. It was a large meeting where GiveWell staff presented content and a few people asked questions.</li>
	<li>December 2015: I published a post on the Effective Altruism Form titled <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/qs/givewell_money_moved_forecasts_and_implications/">GiveWell money moved forecasts and implications</a>.</li>
	<li>May 2016: I published a follow-up post reviewing my forecasts: <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/xn/givewell_money_moved_in_2015_a_review_of_my/">GiveWell money moved in 2015: a review of my forecast and some future predictions</a>. This has some addenda at the end with more recent updates, and links to relevant predictions on PredictionBook.</li>
	<li>June to August 2016 (and continuing): I have sponsored work by Issa Rice, some of which involves investigating GiveWell and its reviews and recommended charities. Examples of work that has resulted from this sponsorship: <a href="https://issarice.com/givewell-executive-compensation">GiveWell executive compensation</a>, <a href="https://issarice.com/givewell-staff-growth">GiveWell staff growth</a>, <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/10l/june_2016_givewell_board_meeting/">June 2016 GiveWell board meeting</a>.</li>
	<li>January 14, 2017: I wrote up some notes on <a href="https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/givewell/website-redesign-costs.md">GiveWell's website redesign costs</a>, and also <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vipulnaik.r/posts/10210743203232119">posted about it on Facebook</a> (<a href="https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/givewell/website-redesign-costs-fb-post.txt">GitHub mirror of post, without the comments</a>).</li>
	<li>July 4, 2017: I posted in the GiveWell Community Facebook group about <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/GiveWellCommunity/permalink/462949240726562/">GiveWell's evolving approach to accountability</a> (<a href="https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/givewell/accountability.txt">GitHub mirror</a>).</li>
</ul>

I have often posted comments on the GiveWell blog and sent emails to info@givewell.org with questions, comments, and suggestions. In addition, Issa Rice has also posted comments and sent emails in connection with research he has done under my pay.
