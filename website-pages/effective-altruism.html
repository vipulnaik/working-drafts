<em>This post gives some general information on my interest in effective altruism. For my history of financial donations, see <a href="/donation-history">here</a>. You can also look at the <a href="/donations-list-website/">Donations List Website</a>, a preliminary, un-vetted website I am using to track donors, donees, and donations.</em>

I've had some involvement with the effective altruism movement (<a href="http://www.effective-altruism.com">central website</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism">Wikipedia page</a>, <a href="http://info.cognitomentoring.org/wiki/Effective_altruism_learning_resources">list of learning resources</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/">Facebook group</a>).

I used to post reasonably often in the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/">Effective Altruists Facebook group</a>, and I recommend that you join the group if you're interested, even if you don't identify as an effective altruist in the strong sense.

Organizations related to effective altruism that I have interacted with or whose work I have discussed at significant length include <a href="http://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a> (see <a href="https://vipulnaik.com/givewell/">my page about my history with GiveWell</a>) and the <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org">Open Philanthropy Project</a> (see <a href="https://vipulnaik.com/open-philanthropy-project/">my page about my interaction with the Open Philanthropy Project</a>).

Some of my writings related to my personal involvement with effective altruism as well as some general observations concerning it are below. You can get additional lists of writings by clicking to my pages above about GiveWell and the Open Philanthropy Project.
