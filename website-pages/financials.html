This page provides a broad overview of the history of my financials.

I'll start the history from September 2007, when I joined the University of Chicago for <a href="/graduate">graduate studies</a>. Until that time, I wasn't maintaining separate personal finances, and was largely relying on my parents and scholarships for financial support.

<h4>2007-2013</h4>

As somebody on a 'F' student visa status (see my <a href="/immigration-status">immigration status</a> for more) I had one major financial advantage over Americans in terms of finances: I didn't need to pay Social Security taxes for the first five years (due to exclusion based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantial_Presence_Test">Substantial Presence Test</a>). This allowed me to build my savings at a slightly higher rate than might otherwise be feasible. Additionally, I also had a scholarship that paid additional money for the first two years, so I was rapidly able to build a decent savings buffer between 2007 and 2009 (reaching about $20,000 in savings).

In 2009, 2010, and 2011, however, I spent out a large amount of my savings making <a href="/donation-history">donations</a> and in a one-off investment. While none of these decisions are ones that I believe were transparently and very clearly terrible, I think that with the benefit of hindsight I might not have made at least some of them. This would have allowed my savings buffer to grow to a larger amount and given me considerably greater flexibility. By October 2011, after all these had been done, my savings in the US were at a precariously low level of about $5000 (this isn't as low as it sounds, because I had made some advance payments).

Between October 2011 and December 2013, I gradually built back my savings. However, I was working harder and longer hours and consequently eating out more, as well as spending more money on things like web hosting, so my savings rate fell. I still managed to get to a savings level of around $15,000, but I spent only $500 in charitable donations over that period.

I intended to work on <a href="/cognito-mentoring">Cognito Mentoring</a> with Jonah Sinick starting January 2014. This would likely not pay well at the outset, and although I planned to do some contract work to meet the immigration status requirements of my Optional Practical Training (OPT) I expected to be losing about $500-1000 every month (i.e., that would be my gap between expenses and income). So I transferred about $5000 from one of my India accounts back to the US (this simply reversed a transfer I had made <em>to</em> India of the same amount). I also asked my parents to send me some money to provide a financial buffer. They each sent $5000, bringing my total savings at the end of December 2013 to $30,000.

<h4>2014 and early 2015</h4>

In January 2014, I moved to South Berkeley to live with Jonah. Between January and August 2014, I did a number of part-time jobs, including work for the <a href="/miri">Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a>. The total income I got from these was in the ballpark of $12,000. My expenses (including tax payments and rent) over the same time period were about $19,000 (the tax payment was $3,000, which was probably an overpayment, but I wanted to be on the safe side). On August 18, 2014, I started my new <a href="/job">job</a>, at a pay of $100,000 per year. In practice, after accounting for various sorts of income tax withholding, this means a payment of about $2750 every fortnight. I made about $22,000 from my job in the calendar year 2014. My expenditure over the time period was in the range of $10,000, bringing my total savings to about $12,000. My net savings through 2014 were about $5,000, and at the end of the year, I had somewhere between $34,000 and $35,000 in relatively liquid assets (bank account, Bitcoin, and PayPal).

In December 2014, I bought about 8.9 Bitcoins at a cost of $3000 USD via <a href="http://www.coinbase.com">Coinbase</a>. I bought an additional $500 of Bitcoin in January 2015, bringing my total Bitcoin holdings to 11 bitcoins.

<h4>2015 through 2017</h4>

Between 2015 and 2017, I gradually built up my savings. In 2017, I sold about 7.5 Bitcoins out of the 11 Bitcoins I had bought 2014/early 2015 (I did not sell it all at once, but rather sold a lot initially and then sold the rest in small increments throughout the last few months of 2017). I also purchased and partly sold some Ethereum, again from Coinbase. I didn't time my Bitcoin sale perfectly -- if I had delayed selling some of the Bitcoin, I would have made way more money than I did. At the end of 2017, I have a little over $70,000 in savings in my bank balance, between 10,000 and 25,000 dollars in some other forms (PayPal, prepaid taxes and bills). In addition, I have a few tens of thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency (mostly the ~3.5 Bitcoin that I still have, and the corresponding Bitcoin Cash, but also some Ethereum). I also have some savings in India that I am not including for consideration here since I am not actively spending that or transfering to or from that pool of savings.

One of my major expenses during this time has been funding <a href="https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/">contract work</a>. As of early January 2018, I have paid out a little under $75,000 in contract work payments. This has significantly affected the amount of money I have saved; a naive calculation that assumes I would have saved all this money would immediately add $75,000 to my current savings. That is a nontrivial adjustment. However, there are other complications: I might have spent a bit of that money in other ways, for instance, on entertainment or on efficiency tools for myself. I might also have held off on selling some Bitcoin if I had the larger amount of cash savings that I would have had if I hadn't been funding contract work.
