I created my Wikipedia account (I believe) sometime in 2005. I made a number of edits to Wikipedia around 2005-2006, but then reduced my involvement with it for the next few years. I started getting more involved in late 2011, and I created and edited a number of pages in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. My initial involvement with Wikipedia occurred while I was an <a href="/undergraduate">undergraduate</a> studying mathematics and computer science at Chennai Mathematical Institute. On my <a href="/undergraduate-experience">undergraduate experience</a> page, I credit my college roommate <a href="http://shreevatsa.wordpress.com">Shreevatsa</a> with introducing me to the idea of Wikipedia editing and many other aspects of hacker culture.

My user profile on Wikipedia is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Vipul">here</a> and my full list of contributions can be accessed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Vipul">here</a>.

Between April and July 2014, I worked on the <a href="/wikipediaviews">Wikipedia Views</a> website, that allows for easy tabular comparison of view counts of multiple pages across multiple months. You can use the website to access the view counts for pages I created using <a href="https://wikipediaviews.org/displayviewsformultipleyears.php?tag=Pages+created+by+Vipul+Naik&allyears=allyears&drilldown=all">this link</a> (for a month-wise breakdown, use <a href="https://wikipediaviews.org/displayviewsformultiplemonths.php?tag=Pages+created+by+Vipul+Naik&allmonths=allmonths&drilldown=all">this link</a>; to see only totals rather than page-wise breakdowns, see: <a href="https://wikipediaviews.org/displayviewsformultipletagsandmonths.php?tag=Pages+created+by+Vipul+Naik&allmonths=allmonths&drilldown=all">month</a>, <a href="https://wikipediaviews.org/displayviewsformultipletagsandyears.php?tag=Pages+created+by+Vipul+Naik&allyears=allyearss&drilldown=all">year</a>). In 2016 and 2017, I have made a number of improvements to Wikipedia Views, incorporating data from additional sources.

These numbers somewhat overestimate my contribution, because the pages I created were also edited by others. On the other hand, I've also made significant edits to other pages that I'm not including here (and whose view stats you can view <a href="http://wikipediaviews.org/displayviewsformultipleyears.php?tag=Pages+edited+significantly+but+not+created+by+Vipul+Naik&allyears=allyears">here by year</a> or <a href="http://wikipediaviews.org/displayviewsformultiplemonths.php?tag=Pages+edited+significantly+but+not+created+by+Vipul+Naik&allmonths=allmonths">here by month</a>).

Starting March 2017, I have significantly reduced my Wikipedia editing activity, and have shifted my editing activity to the <a href="https://timelines.issarice.com">Timelines wiki</a> maintained by my friend Issa Rice, and whom I am paying for maintaining it. The reason for the move was a controversy at Wikipedia surrounding <a href="/sponsored-wikipedia-editing">sponsored Wikipedia editing</a>, that Issa and I intend to summarize at some point in the future.

I believe that under some restricted circumstances, editing Wikipedia can generate huge social value. You might wish to read <a href="http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/wikipedia.html">this essay</a> by my friend Brian Tomasik on the issue. Brian echoes some of my thoughts, and some of the examples of pages created that he cites (specifically, the Wikipedia pages on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earning_to_give">earning to give</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_for_more_funding">room for more funding</a>) were created by me.
