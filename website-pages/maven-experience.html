<p>On Sunday, February 16, 2020, I became an employee of the <a href="https://maven.io/">Maven Coalition</a> as a result of its acquisition of LiftIgniter (<a href="https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/maven-acquires-machine-learning-personalization-company-liftigniter">completed and announced in March 2020</a>), the company I had been working at since Monday, August 18, 2014. LiftIgniter had been my <a href="https://vipulnaik.com/job/">first full-time job</a>, so depending on how you count it, my job at Maven was either a continuation of my first job, or my second job. You can read about my LiftIgniter experience <a href="https://vipulnaik.com/liftigniter-experience/">here</a>.<br><br><strong>First few months at the job</strong><br><br>For the first three weeks, we reported to a WeWork that Maven used for its San Francisco region employees. In the second week, I made a trip, along with other LiftIgniter engineers, to the Maven headquarters in Seattle. The goal was to meet the bulk of the engineering, design, and product (EDP) team that was based in Seattle.<br><br>March 6, 2020 was the last day I went to the WeWork office in San Francisco. After that, I decided to work from home due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) situation; a couple days later, the company made work from home the official policy for everybody. Since then, I've been working from home from where I live in Berkeley. Maven relinquished the WeWork office (that had been on a month-to-month lease) at the end of March.<br><br>There is a plan for me and the other engineers to move to Seattle; however, as of May 2020, I am deferring moving because of the COVID-19 pandemic.<br><br>Since Maven makes a lot of revenue from advertising and events, the COVID-19 pandemic affected revenue significantly. As a result, Maven <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/investing/maven-coronavirus-reduce-costs-layoffs">made workforce cuts and instituted a hiring freeze</a> on March 30, 2020. The cuts were mostly in sales and I wasn't affected; the hiring freeze does slow down some plans to offload some work. At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic has slowed down some other work streams. It's hard to assess the net impact on my workload in the short and medium term, but I expect that overall it will be a little higher than it would be in the counterfactual of no COVID-19.</p>
