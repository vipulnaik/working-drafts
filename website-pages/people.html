This page lists other people whose websites you might be interested in visiting if you found my website useful or interesting. I begin by listing some people I've collaborated with closely in the past or have regular current interaction with, and can provide more color on. At the end, I list some others whom I don't know that well but whose work I've found interesting and enlightening.

<h4>Issa Rice</h4>

Living in: Seattle area, Washington state, United States

Personal website: <a href="https://issarice.com">issarice.com</a>

Other online projects: <a href="https://aiwatch.issarice.com/">AI Watch</a> (<a href="https://github.com/riceissa/aiwatch">GitHub</a>), <a href="https://causeprioritization.org">Cause Prioritization Wiki</a>

As of January 2018, Issa is a freelance researcher who mostly does <a href="https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Issa+Rice">contract work for me</a> (but may be open to other opportunities as well).

I first came to know Issa on January 1, 2014, when he contacted <a href="/cognito-mentoring">Cognito Mentoring</a>, an experimental mentoring service that Jonah Sinick and I had announced on LessWrong on December 28, 2013. We had some email correspondence in the next few months. Starting around August 2014, after Cognito Mentoring had gone in standby mode, I began more one-on-one online interaction with Issa and I played a key role in influencing him to start the Cause Prioritization wiki, which he officially launched in November 2014. Issa started doing contract work with me in 2015 and ramped up the volume of work significantly around the end of April 2016.

See also Issa's <a href="http://issarice.com/cognito-mentoring">lengthy piece on Cognito Mentoring</a> and his <a href="http://issarice.com/cause-prioritization">note on cause prioritization on his personal website</a>.

Based on my lengthy experience working with Issa, I wrote a LinkedIn recommendation for him, that you can see on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/issarice/">LinkedIn profile</a>. I quote it in full below:

<blockquote>I've paid Issa $40,000+ for contract work over the past two years. My big takeaway: Issa Gets Things Done. I rely on him for drudgery, which he's often able to speed up through his coding skills with Python, SQL, shell scripting, and numerous other languages and frameworks. Where needed, he'll patiently get through mundane data entry with an eye for detail. I know I can bank on him for hard, bang-head-against-the-wall open-ended projects. Apart from thinking, coding, free-form article writing, and systematic tabulation, he shines at communicating and negotiating. He pushes back against unreasonable projects, and comes up with evidence-backed, better-for-all-sides alternatives to my ill-considered project proposals. He has proved an adept manager of both people and systems: he's helped me coordinate contract work tasks I give out to others, and he's helped manage and grow the codebases of many of my projects. He is good at toggling between nailing down the little details and stepping back to ponder the big picture. He's continually sharing ideas on a range of subjects, and offering solid critiques of my own. Work with Issa Rice to expand your imagination of what's possible and learn what it means to truly offload the work part of your projects and still feel the excitement of making progress on them!

See <a href="https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Issa+Rice">https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Issa+Rice</a> for all the tasks I've paid him for.</blockquote>

<h4>Peter Hurford</h4>

In 2017, I corresponded extensively (primarily via Facebook) with Peter Hurford, primarily on topics related to GiveWell, the Open Philanthropy Project, global health, donations, and effective altruism. Peter also sponsored some contract work done by Issa Rice and Sebastian Sanchez; I acted as the payment intermediary for smoother handling of tasks and finances. You can see the list of tasks sponsored by Peter <a href="https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/payer.php?payer=Peter+Hurford">here</a>.

<h4>Sebastian Sanchez</h4>

Living in: Resistencia, Argentina

Sebastian is a freelancer who currently works mostly for me. He started work in April 2016 after seeing my <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/w5/looking_for_wikipedia_article_writers_topics/">solicitation for contract workers</a>. Sebastian saw the solicitation on Facebook; we were already Facebook friends at the time, having been introduced through Sebastian Nickel previously.

Sebastian has worked extensively with me, first on Wikipedia and then on Timelines Wiki, making timelines related to diseases and global health, transportation and communication, water, sanitation, and hygiene, and specific nonprofits and technology companies.

My first substantive contact with Katja was in May 2013, when she got in touch with me for a Workflowy on the costs and benefits of open borders and migration liberalization at large. You can see a list of similar links on Katja's site <a href="https://katjagrace.com/useful-things/">here</a>.

With some assistance from Paul Christiano (mentioned later on this page), Katja began work on the AI Impacts site in 2014 and has been blogging regularly on it in 2015. Although I haven't played any direct role in the site, I've encouraged Katja to work on it and also given her some suggestions.

After making a living as a freelance translator alongside his studies for several years, he is now transitioning into the field of natural language processing. He has also taken up distance studies of computer science at the graduate level.

I first encountered Sebastian in the comments section of a Facebook post by Bryan Caplan. We became Facebook friends on October 26, 2012. Since then, we've interacted a lot on Facebook and worked together in many small ways. Sebastian has written <a href="https://openborders.info/blog/author/sebastian-nickel">blog posts for openborders.info</a>, and in November 2014, we co-launched the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1520172064903930/">Libertarian Effective Altruists Facebook group</a>.

I friended Jonah in November 2011 on Facebook after interacting with him on <a href="https://vipulnaik.com/givewell/">GiveWell's</a> mailing list. We began interacting more substantively in November 2012, and in December 2013, we decided to try out <a href="/cognito-mentoring">Cognito Mentoring</a> together. We shifted the project to standby mode in May 2014, due to a failure to obtain enough traction. Working with Jonah was an enjoyable and stimulating experience.

Jonah is currently head of data science at <a href="http://bioagelabs.com/#about">BioAge Labs</a>, a company doing biomedical research related to combating aging.

Carl is a highly respected thinker known for his objectivity, rationality, and sharp thought, and has been memed in the rationality community. He can be found in the comments sections on numerous blogs and Facebook posts in the effective altruism and rationality communities, as well as the acknowledgements of numerous works in those spaces.
