I've titled this page "immigration status" because that's how many people would talk about it, even though my status since 2007 is a <em>non</em>-immigrant status.

If you enjoy this sort of bureaucracy, you might also be interested in my <a href="http://vipulnaik.com/taxes/">taxes page</a>.

Since September 2007, I have been in student status (F visa status) in the United States. This status was associated with my <a href="/graduate">graduate studies (mathematics Ph.D.) at the University of Chicago</a>. Here are some dates:

<ul>
	<li>July 8, 2007 (approximately): I appeared for my visa interview at the US consulate in Chennai. My visa application was approved, and I picked up my stamped passport a day or two later from the pickup location.</li>
	<li>September 8, 2007: I entered the United States at Chicago O'Hare International Airport, and officially began my student status.</li>
	<li>August 31, 2011 was my last entry to the United States in student status. My last I-94 as a student dates back to that date.</li>
	<li>July 8, 2012: My five-year visa expired. However, I was still in authorized status, because my I-20 was still valid till June 2013.</li>
	<li>Mid-2013: I extended my I-20 twice, first to August 2013, and then to December 2013, because of delays with writing up my <a href="/thesis">thesis</a>.</li>
	<li>October 28, 2013: I sent my Optional Practical Training application, requesting a start date of January 15, 2014.</li>
	<li>Early December 2013: My OPT application was approved.</li>
	<li>January 15, 2014: My Optional Practical Training began.</li>
	<li>October 19, 2014: I submitted my OPT STEM extension application, associated with my <a href="/job">job</a>. This was received on October 21, 2014.</li>
	<li>December 16, 2014: My OPT STEM extension application was approved. I received my EAD card on Sunday, December 21, 2014. This extends my status to June 14, 2016.</li>
	<li>July 13, 2015: The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_I-129">Form I-129 petition</a> for my H-1B status associated with my <a href="http://vipulnaik.com/job">job</a> was approved by the USCIS. I received the authorization documents the next week. The application was made at the beginning of the Fiscal Year 2016 application season. I was in the advanced degree quota, and got through the lottery on April 13, 2015. I did <em>not</em> apply for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premium_Processing_Service">Premium Processing Service</a>.</li>
	<li>October 1, 2015: I transitioned to H-1B status. The status expires on August 19, 2018.</li>
	<li>November 15, 2017: During a vacation in India, I obtained a H-1B visa from the Chennai consulate associated with my H-1B status. The visa expires on August 9, 2018.</li>
	<li>November 28, 2017: I entered the United States for the first time in H-1B status. My most recent I-94 is for this date.</li>
</ul>

Thus, from September 8, 2007 to September 30, 2015, I was in F status in the United States, and since October 1, 2015, I am in H-1B status. I am an Indian citizen but due to my lengthy absence from India, my status in India is now that of non-resident Indian. In the United States, I am a resident for tax purposes, but this is not to be confused with "permanent resident" which is a term used for immigration purposes. I acquired residency for tax purposes in 2012, after five calendar years (2007-2011) of exemption based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantial_Presence_Test">Substantial Presence Test</a>.
