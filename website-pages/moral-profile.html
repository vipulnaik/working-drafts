I'm very interested in morality, both in the sense of what's actually moral, and in the sense of what people think is moral. In addition to my interest in moral <e>philosophy</em> (which is largely about what's actually moral), I'm also interested in moral <em>psychology</em> (which is largely about what people <em>consider</em> moral). For those who share my interest in either, and/or want to know about my moral views, the information below might be relevant.

<h4>Meta-ethical views (self-assessments)</h4>

<ul>
	<li>I consider myself a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_realism">moral realist</a> (as opposed to a subjectivist or non-cognitivist). In other words, I believe that some moral propositions are true and can be known to be true.</li>
	<li>I consider myself an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_intuitionism">ethical intuitionist</a>. In other words, I believe that ethical intuitions are an appropriate starting point for the discovery of moral truths.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Normative ethical views</h4>

<ul>
	<li>I subscribe to a mix of deontological and consequentialist ethics.</li>
	<li>I believe in some variant of natural rights or negative rights.</li>
	<li>I tend to be libertarian in my ethical views. For instance, in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Chart">Nolan Chart</a>, I am at the top right: I believe in significant personal and economic freedom. My Moral Foundations results are also consistent with a libertarian profile.</li>
	<li>The consequentialist ethics is largely but not entirely utilitarian. I am not a negative utilitarian, i.e., I do not see the avoidance of suffering as an overriding consideration relative to the attainment of positive affect. At the same time, I do see suffering reduction as important.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Views on the relative importance of different living creatures</h4>

<ul>
  <li>I believe that all animals that experience consciousness deserve some moral consideration, though, in light of my focus on negative rights, I think the general obligation to animals is to, where it is not too costly, not cause them unnecessary suffering or deprive them of their life and liberty.</li>
  <li>I consider humans to have greater moral importance than animals, due to a variety of reasons including their more enhanced cognitive development and their greater ability to understand the future.</li>
  <li>I have uncertainty about the relative moral importance of animals, or the sorts of ways it is morally permissible to humans to exploit animals. Like <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2016/10/the_huemer_grap.html">Mike Huemer</a>, I believe that most meat-eating and factory farming are likely unethical, partly because it is feasible for humans to live and flourish without engaging in these activities. I am less certain about other animal-killing activities, such as pest control. Luke Muehlhauser's <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/2017-report-consciousness-and-moral-patienthood">2017 Report on Consciousness and Moral Patienthood</a> says that insects are less likely to have the properties of consciousness than fish, chicken, and other animals humans generally eat.</li>
</ul>

As you can see from my <a href="https://vipulnaik.com/diet/">diet page</a>, I am vegetarian. The reasons for this are primarily habit and health rather than moral concerns, though the moral considerations do influence me somewhat.
    
<h4>Views on the supernatural</h4>

I am an atheist and a methodological naturalist, i.e., I do not believe in the existence of a supernatural being, nor do I believe that morality is derived from such a being.

<h4>Moral foundations</h4>

I took the Moral Foundations Questionnaire at <a href="http://www.yourmorals.org">yourmorals.org</a> on August 8, 2010. My scores were as follows. Lower scores indicate that I am less tuned to that dimension and/or consider it less important for my definition of morality.

<ul>
	<li>Harm/care foundation: 2.5 (mean for liberals: 3.7, mean for conservatives: 3.1)</li>
	<li>Fairness foundation: 2.2 (mean for liberals: 3.8, mean for conservatives: 3.1)</li>
	<li>Loyalty/ingroup foundation: 1.2 (mean for liberals: 2.1, mean for conservatives: 3.1)</li>
	<li>Authority foundation: 2.3 (mean for liberals: 2.1, mean for conservatives: 3.3)</li>
	<li>Purity/sanctity/disgust foundation: 0.3 (mean for liberals: 1.4, mean for conservatives: 2.9)</li>
</ul>
