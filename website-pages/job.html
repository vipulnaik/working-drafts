<p><strong>The Arena Group (return)</strong></p>
<p>I'm resuming work at <a href="https://thearenagroup.net/">The Arena Group</a> (where I worked prior to Equator) starting Monday, March 6, 2023. I'm going to be in a part-time role.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Equator Therapeutics</strong></p>
<p>Starting April 19, 2022, I began work at <a href="https://equatortherapeutics.com/">Equator Therapeutics</a> as its head of data science. I started the job part-time. I transitioned to full-time starting October 1, 2022. The company's co-founder and CEO is my former housemate and Cognito Mentoring collaborator Jonah Sinick. That's how I heard of the company and it was one of the reasons I was interested enough to explore the possibility of working at Equator.</p>
<p>Feedback about my performance at Equator led the Equator leadership to conclude that I would not be a good long-term fit at Equator. Based on this decision, as well as timelines communicated to me, I decided to leave Equator. My last day at Equator is expected to be March 3, 2023.</p>
<p>I learned a lot of things in my short stay at Equator, and may say more about these learnings in a few months' time, after getting more time to reflect on my experience.</p>
<p><strong>Maven Coalition (renamed to The Arena Group)</strong></p>
<p>Starting February 16, 2020, I became an employee of the <a href="https://maven.io">Maven Coalition</a> (later renamed <a href="https://thearenagroup.net/">The Arena Group</a>) as a result of its acquisition of LiftIgniter (<a href="https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/maven-acquires-machine-learning-personalization-company-liftigniter">formally completed and announced in March 2020</a>). I switched to a part-time position on April 19, 2022 and my last day at the company was September 30, 2022.</p>

<p><strong>LiftIgniter</strong></p>
<p>Starting August 18, 2014, I've been working full-time for <a href="http://www.liftigniter.com">LiftIgniter</a>, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/17/liftigniter-raises-6-4m-to-bring-website-personalization-to-the-rest-of-the-internet/">Series A</a>-funded company (and Y Combinator alumnus) that used machine learning technology to help websites and apps with personalizing their on-site recommendations. My role involves a mix of data science, designing and improving machine learning algorithms, writing code, customer support, and coordinating the work of other employees.</p>
