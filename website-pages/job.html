Starting August 18, 2014, I've been working full-time for <a href="http://www.liftigniter.com">LiftIgniter</a>, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/17/liftigniter-raises-6-4m-to-bring-website-personalization-to-the-rest-of-the-internet/">Series A</a>-funded company (and Y Combinator alumnus) that uses machine learning technology to help websites and apps with personalizing their on-site recommendations. My role involves a mix of data science, designing and improving machine learning algorithms, writing code, customer support, and coordinating the work of other employees.

Some Quora answers related to what work at the job is like (I'll update this list as I write more answers):

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-work-on-machine-learning-problems-in-a-business-setting/answer/Vipul-Naik">My answer to "What is it like to work on machine learning problems in a business setting?"</a>, written November 1, 2014.</li>
</ul>

Some <a href="http://vipulnaik.com/wikihow/">wikiHow</a> articles I have created as a result of experience I have acquired while working are listed below. All of these were created in my personal capacity, and do not cite or reference anything specific or unique to my job. However, I would not have been interested enough in, or knowledgeable enough about, the topics to write about them if it hadn't been for my job.

</ul>

My experience at the job has also helped enhance my interest in other topics around popularity and web metrics that I was anyway interested in, though it is possible I would have written about them anyways. Some articles in this category are:

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Gauge-the-Popularity-of-a-Topic-Online">How to Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Understand-Your-Website-Audience-Profile">How to Understand Your Website Audience Profile</a></li>
</ul>


I had finished my Ph.D. in December 2013. In the interim months, I worked on a number of personal projects, including <a href="/cognito-mentoring">Cognito Mentoring</a>. I also did contract work for the <a href="/miri">Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a> and for LiftIgniter.
