<p><strong>My personal response to, and personal impact on me, of COVID-19</strong></p>
<ul><li>I "missed the boat" on COVID-19. It was only around late February that I started paying close attention to it, and only in the first week of March that I started increasing my work-from-home frequency because of it. March 6 was the last day I went to the office, and decided to work from home after that. Given that I had access to LessWrong, that had sounded the alarm on COVID-19 by mid-February, I was quite slow to recognize it.</li><li>In the second half of March, I spent considerable time reading about COVID-19 to understand its impact. The three LessWrong posts linked above were during that time. By early April, having made my predictions and decisions based on those predictions, I had decided to stop focusing on COVID-19.</li><li>COVID-19 resulted in some changes to my work situation, but the net effect on me is unclear. See <a href="https://vipulnaik.com/maven-experience/">here</a> for more.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Impact of COVID-19 on other things that I monitor and track (not a list of the most important things affected, just the ones I keep track of)</strong></p>
<ul><li>My impression is that LessWrong did a pretty good job getting ahead of COVID-19, and also a reasonable job moving away from it once the rest of the world had picked up the ball (though they're still focusing quite a bit on it). You can look at the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/coronavirus">LessWrong coronavirus tag</a> to see how LessWrong has responded to COVID-19.</li><li>BART ridership is down a lot. I track BART ridership at <a href="https://bart.vipulnaik.com/">https://bart.vipulnaik.com/</a> where you can plot charts and tables to see the sharp drop in ridership through March and into April. BART has a <a href="https://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2020/news20200225">page</a> with more granular daily data as well.</li><li>English Wikipedia pageviews are <a href="https://wikipediaviews.org/displayviewsformultiplemonths.php?page=[aggregate]&amp;allmonths=allmonths-api&amp;languages[0]=en&amp;languages[1]=de&amp;languages[2]=ru&amp;languages[3]=es&amp;languages[4]=ja&amp;languages[5]=fr&amp;drilldown=human">up about 15% relative to normal</a>, and most of this increase isn't due to COVID-19 content. I wrote a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vipulnaik.r/posts/10221011205805766">Facebook post</a> about this.</li></ul>
