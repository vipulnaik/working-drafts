|-
| 1850 || || Tax || The state of California passes a Foreign Miners' Tax of $20/month on foreign miners in California. The decision to focus on foreign ''miners'' reflects the majority view that the presence of Chinese in city services is appreciated but their competition in mining is not.

|-
| 1868 || July 28 || Treaty || The treaty that would later be known as the [[wikipedia:Burlingame Treaty|Burlingame Treaty]] is ratified in Washington, D.C.
