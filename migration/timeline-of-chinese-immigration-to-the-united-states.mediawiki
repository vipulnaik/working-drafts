|-
| 1644 || || Regime change || China || The {{w|Qing dynasty}} takes over control of China from the {{w|Ming dynasty}}, and maintains the capital at {{w|Beijing}}. Resistance to the Qing, initially led by the deposed Ming, builds in South China, mainly the province of {{w|Guangdong}}. After the Ming resistance is killed off, dissatisfaction with the Qing dynasty continues, and interest in alternative systems is developed through the exchange of goods and ideas carried out via the ports in the South China Sea, such as the {{w|Port of Guangdong}}. In the 19th century, the residents of Guangdong and nearby southern provinces, such as {{w|Fujian}}, develop interest in the United States, due to a mix of its wealth, novel system of government, and success at overthrowing its imperial overlords the British.<ref name=chineseamericanmuseum/>

| 1892 || May 5 || Legislation || United States || The {{w|Geary Act}}, written by California Congressman {{w|Thomas J. Geary}}, becomes law. In addition to extending the Chinese Exclusion Act's prohibition on migration of Chinese laborers for another ten years, the Act also begins requiring Chinese in the United States to obtain and keep "certificates of residence" to demonstrate that they have been present in the United States since before immigration of Chinese laborers was banned. After Ny Look, a Chinese civil war veteran, is arrested for failure to obtain a certification, Judge {{w|Emile Henry Lacombe}} of the U.S. Circuit Court in the Southern District of New York, ruled in {{w|In re Ny Look}} that there are no deportation provisions in the law and Look could not be detained indefinitely therefore he should be released.

| 1898 || March 5, 8 (1897) (argument), March 28 (decision) || Court case || United States || The case ''{{w|United States v.

|-
| 1905 || April 3 (argument), May 8 (decision) || Court case || United States || The case ''{{w|United States v. Ju Toy}}'' is decided by the United States Supreme Court in favor of the United States government. Ju Toy, a United States citizen of Chinese descent, is denied re-entry after a visit to China, but the United States Supreme Court does not overturn the decision, because the law states that the decision of the inspector at the port of entry cannot be overturned. This is an important case in cementing judicial deference and an early precursor to the {{w|consular nonreviewability}} and {{w|plenary power}} doctrines.
|-
| 1906 || April 18 || Disaster || California (San Francisco) || The {{w|1906 San Francisco earthquake}} leads to a number of city government records getting destroyed. This leads to the growth of a form of immigration fraud: Chinese present in the United States claim they are United States citizens, and they try to bring over younger Chinese by claiming those younger Chinese are their children; these children are known as {{w|paper sons}} and paper daughters.
|-
| 1910 || January 21 || Port of entry || California (San Francisco Bay Area) || The {{w|Angel Island Immigration Station}} becomes operational. Immigrants arriving by sea on the West Coast of the United States would be required to pass through Angel Island. Unlike its East Coast counterpart, {{w|Ellis Island}}, Angel Island would have a high rejection rate, partly because Chinese seeking to enter would be subject to heavy scrutiny.
|-
| 1943 || December 17 || Legislation || United States || The {{w|Magnuson Act}} (also known as the Chinese Exclusion Repeal Act), a legislation proposed by {{w|Warren G.

The Act repeals the Chinese Exclusion Act, but the new quota of annual Chinese immigration is set at 105, based on a (flawed) use of the {{w|National Origins Formula}} of the {{w|Immigration Act of 1924}}. Also, restrictions on property ownership by Chinese are not overturned.

|-
| 1965 || October 3 || Legislation || United States || The {{w|Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965}}, also known as the Hart–Celler Act is passed, overturning the old National Origins Formula and using a system of global and per-country quotas that would be less restrictive for Chinese (though still putting them at a disadvantage relative to other countries because the quotas do not scale with the country's population). The Act would become effective June 30, 1968.

The executive order defers deportation of Chinese nationals and their direct dependents who were in the US between 5 June 1989 and 11 April 1990, waives the two-year home country residence requirement, and gives employment authorization through January 1, 1994.
|-
| 1992 || October 9 || Legislation || United States || The {{w|Chinese Student Protection Act}} is signed into law by President George H. W.
