This page provides a timeline of major organizations not affiliated with the United States government, that deal with migration-related matters for the United States. Some of them have a more global focus. The list includes:

* Think tanks for research or advocacy, on any side of the issue (for migration, against migration, for more selective migration, etc.)
* Research or advocacy centers in existing universities or think tanks
* Legal resource groups (that provide legal information and services to migrants, potential migrants, and those related to them)
* Grassroots/community organizing efforts
* Mailing lists, websites, and other forums where people congregate to discuss these issues
