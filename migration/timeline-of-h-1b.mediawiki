== H-1B annual cycle dates ==

The portion of this table from Fiscal Year 2014 to Fiscal Year 2017 is taken from Wikipedia's {{w|Premium Processing Service#Pre-announced delays for processing cap-subject petitions}} page, and is subject to the same CC-by-SA license. However, the original table was mostly constructed by the author of this Timelines wiki page.

For context: the annual quotas for H-1B apply every Fiscal Year. A Fiscal Year begins on October 1 of the previous calendar year and ends on September 30 of the same calendar. For instance, Fiscal Year 2004 is from October 1, 2003 to September 30, 2004.

The H-1B petition is filed using {{w|Form I-129}}, and any Form I-129 petition can be submitted at most six months in advance of the indicated start date. Therefore, petitions for cap-subject petitions in a given Fiscal Year start on April 1 of the preceding calendar year.

If the number of petitions received in the first week of April (i.e., the first five working days from the time applications open) exceeds the cap (of 65,000 + 20,000 cap-exempt) after accounting for the rejection rate on petitions, a lottery is conducted to select which petitions will be processed. USCIS stops accepting further petitions. Lotteries have been conducted every year since Fiscal Year 2014 (April 2013).

Otherwise, USCIS announces that it is continuing to receive petitions, and then announces later when it has met the cap and is no longer accepting petitions. In this latter case, USCIS does not conduct a lottery, but rather processes all petitions till the cap is hit.

Due to the huge influx of petitions right around April 1, USCIS has, from Fiscal Years 2014 to 2017, pre-announced delays in the start date for the 15-day countdown for Premium Processing. In other words, even if your petition is received on April 1 and you request Premium Processing Service, the 15-day countdown for Premium Processing Service only begins on the later date indicated by USCIS.

Early April is sometimes called "H-1B season", "H-1B cap season", "H-1B filing season", or "H-1B petition season", and is the subject of much informal discussion among petitioners, beneficiaries, and commentators.
