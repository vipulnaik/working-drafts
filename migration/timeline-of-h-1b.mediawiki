Additionally, the Immigration Act of 1990 also creates the employment-based (EB) immigration category for permanent immigration. The H-1B and EB would play an important symbiotic role, in particular because unlike the previous H-1 visa, it allows for a dual immigrant intent, i.e., it allows people with pending green card applications to use the H-1B.<ref name=cato-h-4/><ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1184#b|title = 1184|publisher = Legal Information Institute}}</ref>

The guidance states: "we will generally consider the position of programmer to qualify as a specialty occupation. This will especially be true if the position involves providing clients with programming analysts, custom designs, modification, and/or problem solving software. Positions such as these are usually associated with consulting firms. However, positions strictly involving the entering or reviewing of code for an employer whose business is not computer related (does not furnish software or hardware development, production, and/or consulting) may require more careful scrutiny." The reasoning in the memo draws on the ''{{w|Occupational Outlook Handbook}}'', past unpublished decisions of the {{w|Administrative Appeals Office}}, and past case law, such as ''Matter of Caron International, inc. I&N Dec. 79-1 (Comm, 1988).<ref name=aila-terry-way-nsc-computer>{{cite web|url = https://www.aila.org/library/nsc-guidance-on-h-1b-computer-related-positions|title = Guidance memo on H1B computer related positions|last = Way|first = Terry|date = December 22, 2000|accessdate = August 4, 2024|publisher = Immigration and Naturalization Service}}</ref> The memo would be rescinded in March 2017<ref name=rescission-terry-way/> though the rescission itself would be subsequently reversed.

Yates, Associate Director of Operations, issues new guidance to USCIS adjudicators to defer to prior adjudications with the same petitioner and beneficiary. In particular prior approvals should generally be given deference, except in cases where: (1) it is determined that there was a material error with regard to the previous petition approval; (2) a substantial change in circumstances has taken place; or (3) there is new material information that adversely impacts the petitioner’s or beneficiary’s eligibility. In general, deference is expected for subjective assessments. While this guidance affects all petitions, the H-1B category is particularly affected (and the most numerically significant), due to the 3-year limit on H-1B validity, resulting in renewal petitions that could be affected by this guidance. The memorandum also explicitly uses the H-1B when providing an illustrative example.<ref name=prior-approval-memo>{{cite web|url = https://www.hsdl.org/c/view?docid=20258|title = The Significance of a Prior CIS Approval of a Nonimmigrant Petition in the Context of a Subsequent Determination Regarding Eligibility for Extension of Petition Validity|date = April 23, 2004|accessdate = August 4, 2024|publisher = United States Citizenship and Immigration Services}}</ref> This guidance would be rescinded in October 2017<ref name=rescission-prior-approval-memo/> and then reinstated in April 2021.<ref name=reinstatement-prior-approval-memo>{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/archive/uscis-issues-policy-guidance-on-deference-to-previous-decisions|title = USCIS Issues Policy Guidance on Deference to Previous Decisions|date = April 27, 2021|accessdate = August 4, 2024|publisher = United States Citizenship and Immigration Services}}</ref>

Baran, director of the California Service Center of the USCIS, for denying the H-1B petition for Dilip Dodda, a citizen of India with a bachelor's degree, for work as a computer programmer. The USCIS's reasoning is that the position does not qualify as a specialty occupation; this is building on the rescission in March 2017 of the Terry Way memo whose guidance had been that computer-related positions should be considered specialty occupations in most cases. The verdict of the {{w|United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit}} rejects the USCIS's reasoning, considering that the ''{{w|Occupational Outlook Handbook}}'', that USCIS cites for support of its reasoning, contradicts USCIS.

== H-1B petition data ==

=== Data from USCIS on petitions and approvals ===

This data is pieced together from the "Program Reports: H-1B" section of the Reports and Studies page on the USCIS website.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies|title = Reports and Studies|accessdate = August 4, 2024|publisher = United States Citizenship and Immigration Services}}</ref> Data for the last column is not available for all years. From 2019 to 2020, there was a slight methodology change; a footnote explains: "Beginning in FY 2020, only petitions filed during a given fiscal year are counted in the number of petitions filed. This differs from prior year reports which reported data that were current at the time that the database was queried."

As can be seen from the numbers here, the number of H-1B petitions filed as well as the number approved per fiscal year is significantly greater than the total cap of cap-subject H-1Bs (65,000 + 20,000 including the masters exemption). The difference is made up by both petitions corresponding to employers exempt from the cap (educational, nonprofit, and research organizations) and petitions from people who (a) had been cap-subject in the past, got selected, and have not yet exhausted the 6-year total under their cap, or (b) have a pending or approved Form I-140 and are therefore eligible for unlimited H-1B renewals while waiting for their immigrant visa or green card. (b) in particular is a growing category, particularly for people from India, due to the increasing backlog in immigrant visa availability.

=== Data fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2020 (after the H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004; no major legislative changes) ===

The annual caps for H-1B (65,000 regular cap-subject, 20,000 for people with U.S. Masters degrees) apply every fiscal year. A fiscal year begins on October 1 of the previous calendar year and ends on September 30 of the same calendar. For instance, fiscal year 2004 is from October 1, 2003 to September 30, 2004.

The H-1B petition is filed using {{w|Form I-129}}, and any Form I-129 petition can be submitted at most six months in advance of the indicated start date. Therefore, cap-subject petitions in a given fiscal year start on the first weekday of April (usually April 1, sometimes April 2 or April 3) of the preceding calendar year. Early April is sometimes called "H-1B season", "H-1B cap season", "H-1B filing season", or "H-1B petition season", and is the subject of much informal discussion among petitioners, beneficiaries, and commentators.

Starting with fiscal year 2006, USCIS has implemented a lottery to determine what petitions to adjudicate if it hits the cap. According to this regulation, all petitions received ''before'' the date the USCIS hits its cap are processed, but petitions received on the day it hits the cap are run through a lottery that selects the number necessary to just hit the cap.<ref name=uscis-lottery-regulation/>

For fiscal year 2008, USCIS had to close petitions after just two days of receiving petitions.<ref name=fy-08-h-1b-lottery/> The heavy pressure on service centers and overnight courier services<ref name=nlr-lottery-lawsuit/> at the start of cap season led to USCIS changing its process somewhat starting fiscal year 2009. USCIS would now wait at least the first five working days of April to receive petitions, and, if enough petitions were received in the first five days, it would put ''all'' petitions received in the first five days (not just those on the last day) through its lottery to determine which petitions would be adjudicated.<ref name=nlr-lottery-lawsuit/><ref name=fy-09-h-1b-lottery/> USCIS has achieved its cap after five days in every fiscal year starting fiscal year 2014 onward (see table below).

Due to the huge influx of petitions right around April 1, USCIS, for fiscal years 2014 through 2017, pre-announced delays in the beginning of countdown for Premium Processing Service; the 15-day countdown for petitions submitted between April 1 and this delayed start date would start on the delayed start date, rather than the date the petition was received. For fiscal years 2018 and 2019, Premium Processing Service was suspended entirely during the cap season.
