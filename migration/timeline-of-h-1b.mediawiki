== H-1B annual cycle dates ==

=== Data Fiscal Year 2006 onward (after the H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004; no major legislative changes) ===

The annual caps for H-1B (65,000 regular cap-subject, 20,000 for people with U.S. Masters degrees) apply every Fiscal Year. A Fiscal Year begins on October 1 of the previous calendar year and ends on September 30 of the same calendar. For instance, Fiscal Year 2004 is from October 1, 2003 to September 30, 2004.

The H-1B petition is filed using {{w|Form I-129}}, and any Form I-129 petition can be submitted at most six months in advance of the indicated start date. Therefore, cap-subject petitions in a given Fiscal Year start on the first weekday of April (usually April 1, sometimes April 2 or April 3) of the preceding calendar year. Early April is sometimes called "H-1B season", "H-1B cap season", "H-1B filing season", or "H-1B petition season", and is the subject of much informal discussion among petitioners, beneficiaries, and commentators.

Starting with Fiscal Year 2006, USCIS has implemented a lottery to determine what petitions to adjudicate if it hits the cap. According to this regulation, all petitions received ''before'' the date the USCIS hits its cap are processed, but petitions received on the day it hits the cap are run through a lottery that selects the number necessary to just hit the cap.<ref name=uscis-lottery-regulation/>

For Fiscal Year 2008, USCIS had to close petitions after just two days of receiving petitions.<ref name=fy-08-h-1b-lottery/> The heavy pressure on service centers and overnight courier services<ref name=nlr-lottery-lawsuit/> at the start of cap season led to USCIS changing its process somewhat starting Fiscal Year 2009. USCIS would now wait at least the first five working days of April to receive petitions, and, if enough petitions were received in the first fivedays, it would put ''all'' petitions received in the first five days (not just those on the last day) through its lottery to determine which petitions would be adjudicated.<ref name=nlr-lottery-lawsuit/><ref name=fy-09-h-1b-lottery/> USCIS has achieved its cap after five days in every fiscal year starting Fiscal Year 2014 onward (see table below).

Due to the huge influx of petitions right around April 1, USCIS delays the countdown start for Premium Processing for cap-subject petitions received at the beginning of the filing season. Prior to Fiscal Year 2014, the delayed start date was announced retroactively, after the first week of receiving petitions; from Fiscal Year 2014 to 2017, the delays were pre-announced.
