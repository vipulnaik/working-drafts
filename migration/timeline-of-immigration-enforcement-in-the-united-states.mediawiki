This page provides a timeline of key events related to immigration enforcement in the [[wikipedia:United States|United States]]. The focus is on enforcement activities such as those carried out by [[wikipedia:U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] and [[wikipedia:U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs and Border Protection]], specifically the [[wikipedia:United States Border Patrol|United States Border Patrol]].

The following are ''not'' covered here: processing of entry of people at ports of entry (carried out by the CBP Office of Field Operations), laws and policies affecting visa processing and processing of immigrant and non-immgrant statuses within the United States (carried out by the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services). However, exceptions are made when these actions tie in directly with immigration enforcement actions (e.g., in cases where some groups are being protected from immigration enforcement, or databases are set up to allow cooperation between these agencies and enforcement agencies).

Laws and programs that prevent aliens (unauthorized, or others) from accessing general public services or private employment or community participation opportunities are also included here.

{| class="wikitable sortable"
! Time period !! class="unsortable" | People in charge !! class="unsortable" | Key developments
|-
| Prior to 1891 || Many people || There is no immigration enforcement to speak of. The only enforcement that occurs is at ports of entry, and this begins with the [[wikipedia:Immigration Act of 1882|Immigration Act of 1882]].
|-
| 1891 to (approximately) 1986 || Many people || There is very little ''systematic'' immigration enforcement, either at the border or in the interior (excluding immigrant processing at ports of entry). Immigration enforcement happens in waves, with large, one-off operations such as the Mexican repatriation and Operation Wetback.
|-
| 1983-1992 || President: [[wikipedia:Ronald Reagan|Ronald Reagan]], [[wikipedia:George H.W. Bush|George H.W. Bush]]<br/>Attorney General: [[wikipedia:Edwin Meese|Edwin Meese]], [[wikipedia:Dick Thornburgh|Dick Thornburgh]]<br/>INS Commissioner: [[wikipedia:Alan C. Nelson|Alan C. Nelson]] || The time period begins with the [[wikipedia:Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986|Immigration and Reform Control Act of 1986]] that combines an amnesty with stricter border and interior enforcement. The period sees the creation of SAVE (a program to help determine an alien's eligibility based on immigration status), a deferred action program (the Reagan/Bush Family Fairness Programs), further tweaks to paths to legal status (the Immigration Act of 1990), and significant increases in resources available to the INS.
|-
| 1993-2000 || President: [[wikipedia:Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton]]<br/>Attorney General: [[wikipedia:Janet Reno|Janet Reno]]<br/>INS Commissioner: [[wikipedia:Doris Meissner|Doris Meissner]] || This period is marked by significant growth of the enforcement machinery as well as enabling legislation. On the legislation side are the [[wikipedia:Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996|Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996]] and the [[wikipedia:Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act|Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]] (known as "welfare reform"). Enforcement includes the launch of [[wikipedia:E-Verify|E-Verify]] and the expansion of SAVE, as well as border operations such as Operation Gatekeeper and Operation Hold the Line. Toward the end of the period, programs such as [[wikipedia:expedited removal|expedited removal]] and [[wikipedia:reinstatement of removal|reinstatement of removal]], authorized by IIRIRA, launch.
|-
| 2001-2008 || President: [[wikipedia:George W. Bush|George W. Bush]]<br/>INS Commissioner: James Ziglar<br/>Secretary for Homeland Security: [[wikipedia:Tom Ridge|Tom Ridge]], [[wikipedia:Michael Chertoff|Michael Chertoff]] || The [[wikipedia:September 11 attacks|September 11 attacks]] in 2001 result in a significant increase in focus on border security, and combating terrorism becomes an important focus of visa policy and immigration enforcement. The INS is disbanded and the [[wikipedia:U.S. Department of Homeland Security|U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] is created; functions of the INS are transferred to new sub-agencies of this department. The period sees continued expansion of removal methods such as expedited removal and [[wikipedia:stipulated removal|stipulated removal]], the end of [[wikipedia:catch and release (U.S. immigration policy)|catch and release]], and a number of enforcement initiatives such as [[wikipedia:Operation Endgame|Operation Endgame]], [[wikipedia:Operation Front Line|Operation Front Line]], [[wikipedia:Operation Streamline|Operation Streamline]], [[wikipedia:Operation Jump Start|Operation Jump Start]], and [[wikipedia:Operation Return to Sender|Operation Return to Sender]]. Legislative efforts towards Comprehensive Immigration Reform fail.
|-
| 2009-2016 || President: [[wikipedia:Barack Obama|Barack Obama]]<br/>Secretary for Homeland Security: [[wikipedia:Janet Napolitano|Janet Napolitano]], [[wikipedia:Jeh Johnson|Jeh Johnson]] || The era begins with continued ramp-up by the Obama administration of policies initiated in the Bush era, such as [[wikipedia:Secure Communities|Secure Communities]]. State governments, beginning with Arizona, pass or attempt to pass legislation that uses state and local government resources to help enforce federal immigration law, leading to lawsuits. Starting with the 2011 Morton memos and the 2012 announcement of DACA, the Obama administration begins to carve out subsets of the unauthorized alien population that it will not try to deport, so that they can continue to live more easily in United States civil society. 
|-
| 2017 || President: [[wikipedia:Donald Trump|Donald Trump]]<br/>Secretary for Homeland Security: [[wikipedia:John F. Kelly|John F. Kelly]] || The election of [[wikipedia:Donald Trump|Donald Trump]] as the President of the United States could yield stronger immigration enforcement. Trump begins with a controversial "Muslim ban" that is overthrown by courts.

| 1904 || || Program rollout || Executive branch || Mounted watchmen under the United States Department of Commerce and Labor (which is tasked with immigrant processing and immigration enforcement) begin patrolling the border. However, efforts are sporadic. This is an early predecessor to what would later become the [[wikipedia:United States Border Patrol|United States Border Patrol]].
|-
| 1915 || Match || Program rollout || Executive branch || The United States Congress authorizes a separate group of mounted guards, called "mounted inspectors", who use horses, automobiles, motorcycles, and boats to patrol the border. However, these inspectors were immigration inspectors as well, i.e., they were juggling the job of processing entry at ports of entry along with patrolling the rest of the border. (Presently, the functions of immigrant processing and border monitoring are handled by separate divisions -- CBP Office of Field Operations and United States Border Patrol).

|1929 || || Program rollout || Executive branch || The [[wikipedia:Mexican Repatriation|Mexican Repatriation]] begins. It is an effort to deport people of Mexican origin and Mexican descent, including those who arrived both legally and illegally, and also including some who are United States citizens. It is initiated by President [[wikipedia:Herbert Hoover|Herbert Hoover]] in the wake of the stock market crash of 1929. The program ends in 1936. Exact numbers of people affected are unclear, though estimates range from 500,000 to 2,000,000. One reason for the unclear estimates is that a lot of people leave voluntarily in the face of the depression, and some of them leave partly because of harassment by authorities (that is part of the repatriation program).
