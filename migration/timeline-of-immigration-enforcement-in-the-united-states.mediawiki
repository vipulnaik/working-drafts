! Time period !! class="unsortable" | Key developments
|-
| Prior to the 1980s || There is very little ''systematic'' immigration enforcement, either at the border or in the interior. Immigration enforcement happens in waves, with large, one-off operations such as the Mexican repatriation and Operation Wetback.
|-
| 1981–2000 (picking up mostly after 1986) || The time period includes the [[wikipedia:Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986|Immigration and Reform Control Act of 1986]] and the [[wikipedia:Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996|Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996]]. Immigration enforcement grows significantly in terms of budget and staff at the Immigration and Naturalization Services, as well as legislation and policy facilitating stronger enforcement.
|-
| 2001–2016|| Increases in resources, laws, and policies to facilitate stronger enforcement continue. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, result in a disbanding of the INS and the creation of a [[wikipedia:U.S. Department of Homeland Security|U.S. Department of Homeland Security]]; functions of the INS are transferred to new sub-agencies of this department. The period, particularly the tail-end under President Barack Obama, is marked by the use of executive orders to determine ''de facto'' immigration policy in the face of significant legislative deadlock.
|-
| 2017 || The election of [[wikipedia:Donald Trump|Donald Trump]] as the President of the United States could yield stronger immigration enforcement.
