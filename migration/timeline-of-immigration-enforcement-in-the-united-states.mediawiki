This page provides a timeline of key events related to immigration enforcement in the {{w|United States}}. The focus is on enforcement activities such as those carried out by {{w|U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement}} and {{w|U.S. Customs and Border Protection}}, specifically the {{w|United States Border Patrol}}.

The following are ''not'' covered here: processing of entry of people at ports of entry (carried out by the CBP Office of Field Operations), laws and policies affecting visa processing and processing of immigrant and non-immigrant statuses within the United States (carried out by the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services). For these topics, see [[timeline of immigrant processing and visa policy in the United States]].

This timeline also does not go into detail on immigration detention practices, including controversies around family detention, family separation, child detention, and conditions at detention centers. For these topics, see [[timeline of immigration detention in the United States]].

However, exceptions are made when these actions tie in directly with immigration enforcement actions (e.g., in cases where some groups are being protected from immigration enforcement, or databases are set up to allow cooperation between these agencies and enforcement agencies).

Laws and programs that prevent aliens (unauthorized, or others) from accessing general public services or private employment or community participation opportunities are also included here.

{| class="wikitable sortable"
! Time period !! class="unsortable" | People in charge !! class="unsortable" | Key developments
|-
| Prior to 1891 || Many people || There is no immigration enforcement to speak of. The only enforcement that occurs is at ports of entry, and this begins with the {{w|Immigration Act of 1882}}.
|-
| 1891 to (approximately) 1982 || Many people || There is very little ''systematic'' immigration enforcement, either at the border or in the interior (excluding immigrant processing at ports of entry). Immigration enforcement happens in waves, with large, one-off operations such as the Mexican repatriation and Operation Wetback.
|-
| 1983{{snd}}1992 || President: {{w|Ronald Reagan}}, {{w|George H.W. Bush}}<br/>Attorney General: {{w|Edwin Meese}}, {{w|Dick Thornburgh}}<br/>INS Commissioner: {{w|Alan C. Nelson}} || The time period begins with the {{w|Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986}} that combines an amnesty with stricter border and interior enforcement. The period sees the creation of SAVE (a program to help determine an alien's eligibility based on immigration status), a deferred action program (the Reagan/Bush Family Fairness Programs), further tweaks to paths to legal status (the Immigration Act of 1990), and significant increases in resources available to the INS.
|-
| 1993{{snd}}2000 || President: {{w|Bill Clinton}}<br/>Attorney General: {{w|Janet Reno}}<br/>INS Commissioner: {{w|Doris Meissner}}|| This period is marked by significant growth of the enforcement machinery as well as enabling legislation. On the legislation side are the {{w|Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996}} and the {{w|Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act}} (known as "welfare reform"). Enforcement includes the launch of {{w|E-Verify}} and the expansion of SAVE, as well as border operations such as Operation Gatekeeper and Operation Hold the Line. Toward the end of the period, programs such as {{w|expedited removal}} and {{w|reinstatement of removal}}, authorized by IIRIRA, launch.
|-
| 2001{{snd}}2008 || President: {{w|George W. Bush}}<br/>INS Commissioner: James Ziglar<br/>Secretary for Homeland Security: {{w|Tom Ridge}}, {{w|Michael Chertoff}} || The {{w|September 11 attacks}} in 2001 result in a significant increase in focus on border security, and combating terrorism becomes an important focus of visa policy and immigration enforcement. The INS is disbanded and the {{w|U.S. Department of Homeland Security}} is created; functions of the INS are transferred to new sub-agencies of this department. The period sees continued expansion of removal methods such as expedited removal and {{w|stipulated removal}}, the end of [[w:catch and release (U.S. immigration policy)|catch and release]], and a number of enforcement initiatives such as {{w|Operation Endgame}}, {{w|Operation Front Line}}, {{w|Operation Streamline}}, {{w|Operation Jump Start}}, and {{w|Operation Return to Sender}}. Legislative efforts towards Comprehensive Immigration Reform fail.
|-
| 2009{{snd}}2016 || President: {{w|Barack Obama}}<br/>Secretary for Homeland Security: {{w|Janet Napolitano}}, {{w|Jeh Johnson}} || The era begins with continued ramp-up by the Obama administration of policies initiated in the Bush era, such as {{w|Secure Communities}}. State governments, beginning with Arizona, pass or attempt to pass legislation that uses state and local government resources to help enforce federal immigration law, leading to lawsuits. Starting with the 2011 Morton memos and the 2012 announcement of DACA, the Obama administration begins to carve out subsets of the unauthorized alien population that it will not try to deport, so that they can continue to live more easily in United States civil society. 
|-
| 2017{{snd}}2020 || President: {{w|Donald Trump}}<br/>Secretary for Homeland Security: {{w|John F. Kelly}}, {{w|Elaine Duke}}, {{w|Kirstjen Nielsen}}, {{w|Kevin McAleenan}}, {{w|Chad Wolf}}<br/>Others: {{w|Stephen Miller (political advisor)}}, {{w|Jeff Sessions}} (Attorney General), {{w|Steve Bannon}} (Senior Counselor to the President) || The election of {{w|Donald Trump}} as the President of the United States results in stronger immigration enforcement, though Trump's efforts (including the initiative to build a {{w|Trump wall}}) are stymied by insufficient cooperation from Congress.
|-
| 2021{{snd}}2024 (?) || President: {{w|Joe Biden}} || The election of {{w|Joe Biden}} begins with the reversal of several Trump-era enforcement changes, bringing immigration enforcement close to where it was at the end of the Obama administration (where Biden had been vice-president).

|-
| 1904 || || Program rollout || Executive branch || Mounted watchmen under the United States Department of Commerce and Labor (which is tasked with immigrant processing and immigration enforcement) begin patrolling the border. However, efforts are sporadic. This is an early predecessor to what would later become the {{w|United States Border Patrol}}.
|-
| 1915 || March || Program rollout || Executive branch || The United States Congress authorizes a separate group of mounted guards, called "mounted inspectors", who use horses, automobiles, motorcycles, and boats to patrol the border. However, these inspectors were immigration inspectors as well, i.e., they were juggling the job of processing entry at ports of entry along with patrolling the rest of the border. (Presently, the functions of immigrant processing and border monitoring are handled by separate divisions -- CBP Office of Field Operations and United States Border Patrol).
|-

|-
| 1929 || || Program rollout || Executive branch || The {{w|Mexican Repatriation}} begins. It is an effort to deport people of Mexican origin and Mexican descent, including those who arrived both legally and illegally, and also including some who are United States citizens. It is initiated by President {{w|Herbert Hoover}} in the wake of the stock market crash of 1929. The program ends in 1936. Exact numbers of people affected are unclear, though estimates range from 500,000 to 2,000,000. One reason for the unclear estimates is that a lot of people leave voluntarily in the face of the depression, and some of them leave partly because of harassment by authorities (that is part of the repatriation program). The program ends in 1936.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Byza6YM2bukC|title=The Praeger Handbook of Latino Education in the U.S.|last=Rosales|first=F.

|-
| 1954 || May || Program rollout || Immigration and Naturalization Services || INS Commissioner {{w|Joseph Swing}} initiates {{w|Operation Wetback}}, a large-scale operation to crack down on illegal immigration from Mexico for agricultural labor. The program is launched while the {{w|Bracero program}}, a guest worker program for agricultural labor, is active. Despite the availability of the Bracero program, many employers and workers choose not to use the program because of the high compliance costs.
|-
| 1956 || || Program rollout || Immigration and Naturalization Services || The {{w|Chinese Confession Program}} starts. The program seeks confessions of illegal entry from US citizens and residents of Chinese origin, with the (somewhat misleading) offer of legalization of status in exchange.
