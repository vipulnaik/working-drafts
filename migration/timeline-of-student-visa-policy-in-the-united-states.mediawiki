It defers deportation of Chinese nationals and their direct dependents who were in the US between 5 June 1989 and 11 April 1990, waives the 2-year home country residency requirement, and gives them employment authorization through 1 January 1994. In particular, this Act affects students, who constitute a large fraction of Chinese nationals temporarily present in the United States.

The INS forms a task force in June 1995 to conduct a comprehensive review of the F, M, and J visa processes. Besides the INS, the task force includes members from the State Department and the United States Information Agency, and experts in the administration of international student programs.<ref name=ins-fsp-report/> The task force report, issued on December 22, 1995, identified problems in the tracking and monitoring of students by schools, problems in the certification of schools by the INS, and problems with INS receiving and maintaining up-to-date records from schools.<ref name=ins-fsp-report/> Based on this, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) directs the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to develop and conduct a program to collect certain information on nonimmigrant foreign students and exchange visitors from approved institutions of higher education and designated exchange visitor programs.<ref name=ins-fsp-report/><ref name=shareok/>
|-
| 1997 || June || || || The INS launches a pilot program for a centralized electronic reporting system for institutions, called the Coordinated Interagency Partnership Regulating International Students (CIPRIS). The CIPRIS pilot would officially end in October 1999, as the INS felt it had gathered enough data from the prototype to start working on the nationwide system.<ref name=ins-fsp-report/><ref name=crs-2008/>
|-
| 1999 || || || || Based on experience gathered from the CIPRIS pilot, the INS begins work on what would be called the {{w|Student and Exchange Visitor Program}} (SEVP), with the associated information system called the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). SEVIS meets with considerable initial opposition from the {{w|Association of International Educators}} and {{w|American Council on Education}}, but they claim that their opposition is not to the program in principle but concern that a botched rollout could affect many students.<ref name=shareok/><ref name=ins-fsp-report/>

The purpose of this guideline is to prevent the export of "goods, technology, or sensitive information" through activities such as "graduate-level studies, teaching, conducting research, participating in exchange programs, receiving training or employment..."; the guidance would be considered responsible for the greater rejection rate of visa applications in subjects with potential application to military and other state uses.<ref name=bu-tal>{{cite web|url = https://www.bu.edu/isso/files/pdf/tal.pdf|title = Technology Alert List|date = August 1, 2002|accessdate = April 29, 2021|publisher = U.S. Department of State}}</ref><ref name=cmu-tal>{{cite web|url = https://www.cmu.edu/oie/foreign-scholars/travel/tech-alert-list.html|title = Technology Alert List|accessdate = April 29, 2021|publisher = Carnegie Mellon University}}</ref>
