|-
| 1905 || {{dts|August 11}} || Legislation || Executive branch, specifically home ministry || The {{w|Aliens Act 1905}} is the first Act to introduce immigration controls and registration. The {{w|Home Secretary}} is given overall responsibility for immigration and nationality matters. While the Act is ostensibly designed to prevent paupers and criminals from migrating and to deport those who migrated, its unstated motivation seems to be to control Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe.
|-
| 1914 || {{dts|August 5}} || Legislation || Executive branch, specifically home ministry || The {{w|Aliens Restriction Act 1914}} is passed in a single day on the eve of {{w|World War I}}. The Act requires every person entering the country to produce evidence of identity at the time of entry. The Act effectively supersedes the Aliens Act 1905 due to much more stringent provisions.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/aliens.asp |title= Aliens Registration Cards |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |accessdate=25 August 2011}}</ref> The power still remains in use.<ref>https://www.gov.uk/register-with-the-police</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1914/12/pdfs/ukpga_19140012_en.pdf|title = Aliens Restriction Act, 1914|accessdate = November 19, 2017}}</ref>

|-
