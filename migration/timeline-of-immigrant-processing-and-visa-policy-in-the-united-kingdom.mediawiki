This page provides a timeline of key events related to immigrant processing and visa policy of the United States. It focuses on laws, policies, and programs affecting pathways for authorized entry to the United States and long-term immigrant and non-immigrant statuses. It is complementary to the [[timeline of immigration enforcement in the United Kingdom]].

The timeline is still under construction. We aim for it to have comparable coverage to [[timeline of immigrant processing and visa policy in the United States]]. In the meantime, a useful Wikipedia reference article is {{w|History of UK immigration control}}.
