This page provides a timeline of key events related to immigrant processing and visa policy of the United States. It focuses on laws, policies, and programs affecting pathways for authorized entry to the United States and long-term immigrant and non-immigrant statuses. It is complementary to the [[timeline of immigration enforcement in the United States]].

The programs discussed here mostly come under the purview of the [[wikipedia:United States Citizenship and Immigration Services|United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]], the [[wikipedia:U.S. Customs and Border Protection|U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] Office of Field Operations, and the U.S. Department of State agencies such as the Bureau of Consular Affairs. For the most part, it does ''not'' deal with programs under the purview of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or the United States Border Patrol. There are some exceptions (such as the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, that is under the purview of ICE). To dive deeper into immigration enforcement, look at the [[timeline of immigration enforcement in the United States]].

There are separate timelines with more detailed coverage of specific categories of visa policy: [[timeline of student visa policy in the United States]] and [[timeline of H-1B]].

! Time period !! class="unsortable" | People in charge !! class="unsortable" | Key developments
|-
| Before 1875 || || There is no federal restriction on immigration during this time period. However, there are restrictions on naturalization (initially to free white persons of good moral character, and later to white and black persons) and there are provisions for deportation for sedition. There are also state-level regulations as well as private vigilante action against immigrants, such as against the Chinese in California, that we do not cover in this timeline.
|-
| 1875{{snd}}1924 || Presidents: several, ending with {{w|Warren Harding}} and {{w|Calvin Coolidge}} || The period sees the gradual tightening of immigration, initially beginning with restrictions on Chinese immigration, then expanding to other Asian immigration, and eventually (wiith the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and the Immigration Act of 1924) applying to all immigration.
|-
| 1925{{snd}}1964 || || Immigration restrictions loosen slightly, with the Magnuson Act of 1943 and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, but the basic framework of the restrictive policies of 1924 remains. Though not itself a significant relaxation of immigration, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 provides a legislative framework that would be modified by subsequent legislation.
|-
| 1965{{snd}}1982 || Presidents: {{w|Lyndon B. Johnson}}, {{w|Richard Nixon}}, {{w|Gerald Ford}}, {{w|Jimmy Carter}}, {{w|Ronald Reagan}} (early years) || This period sees the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, a landmark legislation that significantly increases the permissible immigration levels from most places outside of Western Europe, by imposing per-country limits that are similar across countries (this still penalizes high-population countries such as India and China, but is overall much less restrictive than before). The United Stats Refugee Admissions Program begins. More temporary worker and fiance/spouse statuses are created.
|-
| 1983{{snd}}1992 || Presidents: {{w|Ronald Reagan}}, {{w|George H. W. Bush}} || The period sees two landmark legislations: the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, that combines amnesty, enforcement, and a more defined temporary worker program, and the Immigration Act of 1990, that creates the contemporary framework for high-skilled immigration.
|-
| 1993{{snd}}2000 || President: {{w|Bill Clinton}} || The period sees several legislations related to migration, including the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA), the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA), the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act (AC21), Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, Legal Immigration Family Equity Act (LIFE Act). Factors at play in these legislations include a desire to get more high-skilled workers, concerns about displacement of American workers, concerns about the impact of immigration on crime and welfare, and humanitarian responsibilities to immigrants who are victims of trafficking or have terrible home country conditions.
|-
| 2001{{snd}}2008 || President: {{w|George W. Bush}} || The period sees some restructuring, partly in response to perceived need for more security after the {{w|September 11 attacks}}. Free trade agreements with Australia, Chile, and Singapore create new visa classes for citizens of those countries.

|-
| 1790 || || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|Naturalization Act of 1790}} is passed, specifying the rules for granting citizenship in the United States. Citizenship is limited to free white persons of good character.
|-
| 1798 || || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|Alien and Sedition Acts}} (a total of four bills) are passed by the {{w|5th United States Congress}} (that is Federalist-dominated) and signed into law by President {{w|John Adams}}.
|-
| 1819 || || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|Steerage Act of 1819}}, also known as the Manifest of Immigrants Act, is passed. The Act regulates the conditions of travel on ships landing in the United States, and imposes a requirement that ships submit a manifest of all immigrants aboard.
|-
| 1855 || || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|Carriage of Passengers Act of 1855}} is passed, replacing the Steerage Act of 1819.
|-
| 1868 || July 28 || Treaty or trade agreement || || || Terms for what would later be known as the [[wikipedia:Burlingame Treaty|Burlingame Treaty]] between the United States and China are finalized. The treaty would be ratified by China in 1869. The Treaty grants most-favored-nation status to China, and allows free movement of people between the countries, but withholding the privilege of naturalization.
|-
| 1870 || July 14 || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|Naturalization Act of 1870}} is signed into law by President {{w|Ulysses S. Grant}} after passing both chambers of the [[wikipedia:41st United States Congress|41st United States Congress]]. The Act extends the naturalization process to ''persons of African nativity and to persons of African descent'' (going beyond the Naturalization Act of 1790 that was limited to free white persons) while still excluding the Chinese and others.
|-
| 1875 || || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|Page Act of 1875}}, the first United States federal restriction on immigration, passes.
|-
| 1881 || October 5 || Treaty or trade agreement || Executive branch || || The {{w|Angell Treaty of 1880}} is ratified. This modifies the previous [[wikipedia:Burlingame Treaty|Burlingame Treaty]] of 1868 between the United States and China, by temporarily suspending the migration of laborers (skilled and unskilled) from China.
|-
| 1882 || May 6 || Legislation (landmark) || Executive branch || || The {{w|Chinese Exclusion Act}} is signed into law by President [[wikipedia:Chester A. Arthur|Chester A.

|-
| 1882 || August 3 || Legislation (landmark) || Executive branch || || The {{w|Immigration Act of 1882}} is signed into law by President [[wikipedia:Chester A. Arthur|Chester A. Arthur]] after passing both chambers of the [[wikipedia:47th United States Congress|47th United States Congress]]. The Act mostly focuses on immigration enforcement but also creates new policies around excludable classes of immigrants.
|-
| 1888 || || Legislation || Executive branch || || The [[w:Scott Act (1888)|Scott Act]] is passed, after the failure of negotiations for the Bayard-Zhang Treaty. The Act applies the same criteria to re-entry of Chinese into the United States as were applied to initial entry by the Chinese Exclusion Act.
|-
| 1889 || || Court case || || || ''{{w|Chae Chan Ping v. United States}}'' is decided by the United States Supreme Court against the petitioner. The case upholds the Scott Act and is one of the first of numerous court cases related to immigration policy and enforcement where the court rules in favor of the government.
|-
| 1891 || March 3 || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|Immigration Act of 1891}} is signed into law by President {{w|Benjamin Harrison}}, after being passed by the [[wikipedia:51st United States Congress|51st United States Congress]].

|-
| 1892 || May 5 || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|Geary Act}}, written by California Congressman {{w|Thomas J. Geary}}, becomes law. In addition to extending the Chinese Exclusion Act's prohibition on migration of Chinese laborers for another ten years, the Act also begins requiring Chinese in the United States to obtain and keep "certificates of residence" to demonstrate that they have been present in the United States since before immigration of Chinese laborers was banned. After Ny Look, a Chinese civil war veteran, is arrested for failure to obtain a certification, Judge {{w|Emile Henry Lacombe}} of the U.S. Circuit Court in the Southern District of New York, ruled in {{w|In re Ny Look}} that there are no deportation provisions in the law and Look could not be detained indefinitely therefore he should be released. This leads to the McCreary Amendment, giving Chinese an additional six months to register, and changing some of the requirements for certificates.
|-
| 1895 || || Organizational restructuring || Bureau of Immigration; modern equivalents are USCIS and CBP || || The Office of Superintendent of Immigration is upgraded to the Bureau of Immigration.<ref name=uscis-organizational-timeline/>
|-
| 1903 || March 3 || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|Immigration Act of 1903}}, also known as the '''Anarchist Exclusion Act''', is signed into law by President [[wikipedia:Theodore Roosevelt|Theodore Roosevelt]], after passing the [[wikipedia:57th United States Congress|57th United States Congress]]. The Act codifies existing immigration law and also provides more grounds for excluding suspected anarchists. It has little practical effect.
|-
| 1903 || || Organizational restructuring || Bureau of Immigration; modern equivalents are USCIS and CBP || || The Bureau of Immigration is transferred to the newly created Department of Commerce and Labor.<ref name=uscis-organizational-timeline/>
|-
| 1906 || || Organizational restructuring || Bureaur of Immigration and Naturalization; modern equivalents are USCIS and CBP || || The Federal Naturalization Service is created, as the setting of policies for naturalization as well as the act of naturalization is now a federal responsibility. The Bureau of Immigration becomes the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization.<ref name=uscis-organizational-timeline/>
|-
| 1907 || February 15 || Informal agreement || Executive branch || || The {{w|Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907}} is informally agreeed upon between the United States and Japan, whereby the United States would not impose restrictions on Japanese immigration and Japan would not allow further emigration to the United States. The agreement would never be ratified by United States Congress, and would eventually be superseded by the {{w|Immigration Act of 1924}}.
|-
| 1907 || February 20 || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|Immigration Act of 1907}} is signed into law by President {{w|Theodore Roosevelt}}, after passing the {{w|59th United States Congress}}. The Act provides more grounds for excluding immigrants.
|-
| 1907 || February || Commission || United States Congress || || The {{w|United States Congress Joint Immigration Commission}} is formed by the United States Congress, to study the origin and consequences of recent immigration to the United States. It is known as the '''Dillingham Commission''' after its chairman, Republican Senator [[wikipedia:William P. Dillingham|William P. Dillingham]]. The Commission completes its work in 1911, producing a 41-volume report. It would be influential in shaping the [[wikipedia:Emergency Quota Act|Emergency Quota Act]] and the [[wikipedia:Immigration Act of 1924|Immigration Act of 1924]], and in particular, the [[wikipedia:National Origins Formula|National Origins Formula]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/immigration/dillingham.html|title = Dillingham Commission (1907–1910)|publisher = Harvard University Library Open Collections Program|accessdate = April 7, 2017}}</ref>
|-
| 1913 || || Organizational restructuring || Bureau of Immigration, Bureau of Naturalization; modern equivalents USCIS and CBP || || The Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization is split into the Bureau of Immigration and the Bureau of Naturalization, and both are placed under the [[wikipedia:United States Department of Labor|United States Department of Labor]].<ref name=uscis-organizational-timeline/>
|-
| 1918 || || Legislation || Executive branch || || A wartime requirement that visas are required for foreigners to enter the United States is made permanent.<ref name=americanbar>{{cite web|url = http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/BriefsV4/13-1402_amicus_resp_lawprofs.authcheckdam.pdf|title = Brief of ''Amicus Curiae'' Law Professors in Support of Respondent (Kerry v.

|-
| 1918 || October 16 || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|Immigration Act of 1918}}, also known as the '''Alien Anarchists Exclusion Act of 1918''', is signed into law by President [[wikipedia:Woodrow Wilson|Woodrow Wilson]] after passing the [[wikipedia:65th United States Congress|65th United States Congress]].
|-
| 1921 || May 19 || Legislation (landmark) || Executive branch || F (students) || The {{w|Emergency Quota Act}}, also known as the '''Emergency Immigration Act of 1921''', the '''Immigration Restriction Act of 1921''', the '''Per Centum Law''', and the '''Johnson Quota Act''', is signed into law by President {{w|Warren G. Harding}} after passing both chambers of the {{w|67th United States Congress}}. It significantly reduces immigration quotas from countries around the world to 3% of the population of the country already present in the United States (this formula would later be called the {{w|National Origins Formula}}).
|-
| 1924 || May 24 || Legislation (landmark) || Executive branch || || The {{w|Immigration Act of 1924}}, also called the '''National Origins Act''' and the '''Asian Exclusion Act''', is signed into law by President [[wikipedia:Calvin Coolidge|Calvin Coolidge]] after passing both chambers of the {{w|68th United States Congress}}. This updates the National Origins Formula to reduce the percentage to 2%.
|-
| 1924 || || Organizational restructuring || United States Border Patrol || || {{w|United States Border Patrol}} is created within the Bureau of Immigration.<ref name=uscis-organizational-timeline/>
|-
| 1933 || || Organizational restructuring || Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS); modern equivalents are USCIS and CBP (and also ICE, though most ICE functions do not exist at the time) || || The Bureau of Immigration and Bureau of Naturalization merge into the [[wikipedia:Immigration and Naturalization Service|Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (INS).<ref name=uscis-organizational-timeline/>
|-
| 1940 || || Organizational restructuring || Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS); modern equivalents are USCIS and CBP (and also ICE, though most ICE functions do not exist at the time) || || The Immigration and Naturalization Service is transferred from the Department of Labor to the {{w|United States Department of Justice}} (DOJ), where it would stay for the rest of its life (till early 2003).<ref name=uscis-organizational-timeline/>
|-
| 1943 || || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|Magnuson Act}} becomes law. The Act repeals the Chinese Exclusion Act, but in practice immigration from China is still significantly restricted, as a quota of 105 annual Chinese immigrants is calculated through (flawed) use of the National Origins Formula of the Immigration Act of 1924.
|-
| 1945 || December 28 || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|War Brides Act}} becomes law. The law allows alien spouses, natural children, and adopted children of members of the {{w|United States Armed Forces}}, "if admissible," to enter the U.S. as non-quota immigrants after {{w|World War II}}. This mostly benefits Chinese, whose entry is allowed by the Magnuson Act, but who are subject to strict quotas. The Act would expire on December 31, 1948.
|-
| 1946 || June 29 || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|Alien Fiancées and Fiancés Act of 1946}} extends the War Brides Act by eliminating barriers for Filipino and Indian war brides. A 1947 amendment would also remove barriers for Korean and Japanese war brides. The Act would expire on December 31, 1948.
|-
| 1952 || June 27 || Legislation (landmark) || Executive branch || H (temporary workers) || The {{w|Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952}} becomes law after both chambers of the {{w|82nd United States Congress}} vote to override the veto of President {{W|Harry S. Truman}}. This is the first of two big overhauls of the immigration system (the second being in 1965). Subsequent legislations would often be framed in terms of modifications to this legislation. Among other things, the H visa category is created by this Act.
|-
| 1952 || || Organizational restructuring || U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs; current equivalent: Bureau of Consular Affairs || || This also leads to the creation of the Bureau of Inspection, Security and Consular Affairs, which is responsible for issuing visas at foreign consulates to people who want to enter the United States. In 1954, the Bureau is renamed the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs.
|-
| 1961 || September 21 || Legislation || U.S. Department of State || J (exchange visitors) || The {{w|Fulbright–Hays Act of 1961}}, also known as the Mutual Exchange and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 (MECEA), is signed into law by President {{w|John F. Kennedy}} after passing both chambers of the {{w|87th United States Congress}}. The Act encourages mutual education and cultural exchange between the United States and other countries, and in particular, leads to the creation of the {{w|J-1 visa}} category.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/iegps/fulbrighthaysact.pdf|title = Mutual Education and Cultural Exchange Program|accessdate = April 7, 2017}}</ref>
|-
| 1965 || October 3 || Legislation (landmark) || Executive branch || || The {{w|Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965}}, also known as the Hart–Celler Act for its co-sponsors, is signed into law by President {{w|Lyndon B. Johnson}} after passing both chambers of the {{w|89th United States Congress}}. The Act would go into effect on June 30, 1968. As of 2020, it is the most recent radical overhaul of the immigration system in the United States.
