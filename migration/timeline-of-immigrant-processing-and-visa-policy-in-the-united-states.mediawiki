This page provides a timeline of key events related to immigrant processing and visa policy of the United States. It focuses on laws, policies, and programs affecting pathways for authorized entry to the United States and long-term immigrant and non-immigrant statuses. It is complementary to the [[timeline of immigration enforcement in the United States]].

The programs discussed here mostly come under the purview of the {{w|United States Citizenship and Immigration Services}}, the {{w|U.S. Customs and Border Protection}} Office of Field Operations, and the U.S. Department of State agencies such as the Bureau of Consular Affairs. For the most part, it does ''not'' deal with programs under the purview of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or the United States Border Patrol. There are some exceptions (such as the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, that is under the purview of ICE). To dive deeper into immigration enforcement, look at the [[timeline of immigration enforcement in the United States]].

There are separate timelines with more detailed coverage of specific categories of visa policy: [[timeline of student visa policy in the United States]] and [[timeline of H-1B]].

{| class="wikitable sortable"
! Time period !! class="unsortable" | People in charge !! class="unsortable" | Key developments
|-
| Before 1875 || || There is no federal restriction on immigration during this time period. However, there are restrictions on naturalization (initially to free white persons of good moral character, and later to white and black persons) and there are provisions for deportation for sedition. There are also state-level regulations as well as private vigilante action against immigrants, such as against the Chinese in California, that we do not cover in this timeline.
|-
| 1875{{snd}}1907 || Presidents: many, most prominent being Chester A. Arthur and Theodore Roosevelt || The period sees the growth of federal immigration law to replace the state-level restrictions seen earlier. The Chinese are the main nationality that is explicitly singled out, but other legislation is mainly targeted at other East Asian immigration. Undesirable classes of immigrants begin to be enumerated, and border inspections begin.
|-
| 1907{{snd}}1924 || Presidents: several, ending with {{w|Woodrow Wilson}}, {{w|Warren Harding}} and {{w|Calvin Coolidge}} || The period sees the tightening of immigration, influenced partly by the Dillingham Commission; the Immigration Act of 1917 bars immigration from large parts of Asia, and the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and Immigration Act of 1924 also clamp down on immigration worldwide, with most regions other than Western Europe significantly affected.
|-
| 1925{{snd}}1941 || Presidents: {{w|Calvin Coolidge}}, {{w|Herbert Hoover}}, {{w|Franklin D. Roosevelt}} || Immigration law remains largely unchanged during this period, as the United States transitions from an economic boom to the {{w|Great Depression in the United States}} and then enters {{w|World War II}}.
|-
| 1942{{snd}}1964 || Presidents: {{w|Franklin D. Roosevelt}}, {{w|Harry Truman}}, {{w|Dwight D. Eisenhower}}, {{w|John F. Kennedy}} || Immigration restrictions loosen slightly as the end of World War II heightens the value of international cooperation, and the United States emerges as one of two superpowers in the new world order. Legislations include the Magnuson Act of 1943, the Luceâ€“Celler Act of 1946, and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (as well as temporary legislation such as the War Briides Act), but the basic framework of the restrictive policies of 1924 remains. Though not itself a significant relaxation of immigration, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 provides a legislative framework that would be modified by subsequent legislation.
|-
| 1965{{snd}}1982 || Presidents: {{w|Lyndon B. Johnson}}, {{w|Richard Nixon}}, {{w|Gerald Ford}}, {{w|Jimmy Carter}}, {{w|Ronald Reagan}} (early years) || This period sees the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, a landmark legislation that significantly increases the permissible immigration levels from most places outside of Western Europe, by imposing per-country limits that are similar across countries (this still penalizes high-population countries such as India and China, but is overall much less restrictive than before). The United States Refugee Admissions Program begins. More temporary worker and fiance/spouse statuses are created.
|-
| 1983{{snd}}1992 || Presidents: {{w|Ronald Reagan}}, {{w|George H. W. Bush}} || The period sees two landmark legislations: the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, that combines amnesty, enforcement, and a more defined temporary worker program, and the Immigration Act of 1990, that creates the contemporary framework for high-skilled immigration.
|-
| 1993{{snd}}2000 || President: {{w|Bill Clinton}} || The period sees several legislations related to migration, including the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA), the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA), the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act (AC21), Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, Legal Immigration Family Equity Act (LIFE Act). Factors at play in these legislations include a desire to get more high-skilled workers, concerns about displacement of American workers, concerns about the impact of immigration on crime and welfare, and humanitarian responsibilities to immigrants who are victims of trafficking or have terrible home country conditions.
|-
| 2001{{snd}}2008 || President: {{w|George W. Bush}} || The period sees some restructuring, partly in response to perceived need for more security after the {{w|September 11 attacks}}. Free trade agreements with Australia, Chile, and Singapore create new visa classes for citizens of those countries.

|-
| 1888 || || Legislation || Executive branch || || The [[w:Scott Act (1888)|Scott Act]] is passed, after the failure of negotiations for the Bayard-Zhang Treaty. The Act applies the same criteria to re-entry of Chinese into the United States as were applied to initial entry by the Chinese Exclusion Act. || China
|-
| 1889 || || Court case || || || ''{{w|Chae Chan Ping v. United States}}'' is decided by the United States Supreme Court against the petitioner.

|-
| 1891 || March 3 || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|Immigration Act of 1891}} is signed into law by President {{w|Benjamin Harrison}}, after being passed by the {{w|51st United States Congress}}.

|-
| 1892 || May 5 || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|Geary Act}}, written by California Congressman {{w|Thomas J. Geary}}, becomes law. In addition to extending the Chinese Exclusion Act's prohibition on migration of Chinese laborers for another ten years, the Act also begins requiring Chinese in the United States to obtain and keep "certificates of residence" to demonstrate that they have been present in the United States since before immigration of Chinese laborers was banned. After Ny Look, a Chinese civil war veteran, is arrested for failure to obtain a certification, Judge {{w|Emile Henry Lacombe}} of the U.S. Circuit Court in the Southern District of New York, ruled in {{w|In re Ny Look}} that there are no deportation provisions in the law and Look could not be detained indefinitely therefore he should be released. This leads to the McCreary Amendment, giving Chinese an additional six months to register, and changing some of the requirements for certificates. || China
|-
| 1895 || || Organizational restructuring || Bureau of Immigration; modern equivalents are USCIS and CBP || || The Office of Superintendent of Immigration is upgraded to the Bureau of Immigration.<ref name=uscis-organizational-timeline/>
|-
| 1903 || March 3 || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|Immigration Act of 1903}}, also known as the '''Anarchist Exclusion Act''', is signed into law by President {{w|Theodore Roosevelt}}, after passing the {{w|57th United States Congress}}. The Act codifies existing immigration law and also provides more grounds for excluding suspected anarchists. It has little practical effect.
|-
| 1903 || || Organizational restructuring || Bureau of Immigration; modern equivalents are USCIS and CBP || || The Bureau of Immigration is transferred to the newly created Department of Commerce and Labor.<ref name=uscis-organizational-timeline/>
|-
| 1906 || September 27 || Legislation, organizational restructuring || Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization; modern equivalents are USCIS and CBP || || The {{w|Naturalization Act of 1906}} (revising the Naturalization Act of 1906) is signed into law by President {{w|Theodore Roosevelt}} after passing both houses of th {{w|59th United States Congress}}. The Act requires immigrants to learn English in order to naturalize, and also makes naturalization a federal responsibility. The Federal Naturalization Service is created, as the setting of policies for naturalization as well as the act of naturalization is now a federal responsibility. The Bureau of Immigration becomes the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization.<ref name=uscis-organizational-timeline/> This is the last named "Naturalization Act" (further Acts in this domain would be called Nationality Acts).
|-
| 1907 || February 15 || Informal agreement || Executive branch || || The {{w|Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907}} is informally agreeed upon between the United States and Japan, whereby the United States would not impose restrictions on Japanese immigration and Japan would not allow further emigration to the United States. The agreement would never be ratified by United States Congress, and would eventually be superseded by the {{w|Immigration Act of 1924}}. || Japan
|-
| 1907 || February 20 || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|Immigration Act of 1907}} is signed into law by President {{w|Theodore Roosevelt}}, after passing the {{w|59th United States Congress}}. The Act provides more grounds for excluding immigrants.
|-
| 1907 || February || Commission || United States Congress || || The {{w|United States Congress Joint Immigration Commission}} is formed by the United States Congress, to study the origin and consequences of recent immigration to the United States. It is known as the '''Dillingham Commission''' after its chairman, Republican Senator {{w|William P. Dillingham}}. The Commission completes its work in 1911, producing a 41-volume report. It would be influential in shaping the {{w|Immigration Act of 1917}}, the {{w|Emergency Quota Act}}, and the {{w|Immigration Act of 1924}}, and in particular, the {{w|National Origins Formula}}.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/immigration/dillingham.html|title = Dillingham Commission (1907â€“1910)|publisher = Harvard University Library Open Collections Program|accessdate = April 7, 2017}}</ref>

|-
| 1917 || February 5 || Legislation (landmark) || Executive branch || || The {{w|Immigration Act of 1917}} is passeed by both houses of the {{w|64th United States Congress}} over the veto of President {{w|Woodrow Wilson}}. The legislation expands and consolidates the list of undesirables banned from entering the United States, including "illiterates" over the age of 16 as undesirables. It also creates an "Asiatic barred zone" from which immigration is not allowed; this includes China, British India, Afghanistan, Arabia, Burma (Myanmar), Siam (Thailand), the Malay States, the Dutch East Indies, the Soviet Union east of the Ural Mountains, and most Polynesian islands. The Asian exclusions do not apply to those working in certain professional occupations and their immediate families: "(1) Government officers, (2) ministers or religious teachers, (3) missionaries, (4) lawyers, (5) physicians, (6) chemists, (7) civil engineers, (8) teachers, (9) students, (10) authors, (11) artists, (12) merchants, and (13) travelers for curiosity or pleasure". || China, British India, Afghanistan, Arabia, Burma (Myanmar), Siam (Thailand), the Malay States, the Dutch East Indies, the Soviet Union east of the Ural Mountains, and most Polynesian islands

Harding}} after passing both chambers of the {{w|67th United States Congress}}. It significantly reduces immigration quotas from countries around the world to 3% of the population of the country already present in the United States (this formula would later be called the {{w|National Origins Formula}}). || Differently affects different countries based on populations from them already in the United States
|-
| 1923 || || Court case || || || In ''{{w|United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind}}'', the {{w|Supreme Court of the United States}} rules that {{w| Bhagat Singh Thind}}, an Indian Sikh man who self-identifies as Aryan, is ineligible to naturalize, as the law allows only "free white persons" and "aliens of African nativity and persons of African descent" to become United States citizens by naturalization. || India
|-
| 1924 || May 24 || Legislation (landmark) || Executive branch || || The {{w|Immigration Act of 1924}}, also called the '''Johnsonâ€“Reed Act''', and including parts known as the '''National Origins Act''' and the '''Asian Exclusion Act''', is signed into law by President {{w|Calvin Coolidge}} after passing both chambers of the {{w|68th United States Congress}}. This updates the National Origins Formula to reduce the percentage to 2%. || Differently affects different countries based on populations from them already in the United States
|-
| 1924 || || Organizational restructuring || United States Border Patrol || || {{w|United States Border Patrol}} is created within the Bureau of Immigration.<ref name=uscis-organizational-timeline/>
|-
| 1933 || || Organizational restructuring || Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS); modern equivalents are USCIS and CBP (and also ICE, though most ICE functions do not exist at the time) || || The Bureau of Immigration and Bureau of Naturalization merge into the {{w|Immigration and Naturalization Service}} (INS).<ref name=uscis-organizational-timeline/>
|-
| 1934 || March 24 || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|Tydingsâ€“McDuffie Act}} establishes the process for {{w|Philippines}}, then an American colony, to become an independent country after a ten-year transition period. This also destroys freedom of movement from Philippines to the United States, as the now-to-be-independent Philippines is part of the Asiatic barred zone created by the Immigration Act of 1917 and reinforced by the Immigration Act of 1924. || Philippines
|-
| 1935 || || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|Filipino Repatriation Act of 1935}} establishes a program to subsidize the return passage to the Philippines for Filipinos currently living in the United States. This is a followup to the {{w|Tydingsâ€“McDuffie Act}} that starts the process of Filipino independence and bans Filipino immigration. || Philippines
|-
| 1940 || October 14 || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|Nationality Act of 1940}} is signed into law by President {{w|Franklin D. Roosevelt}} after passing both chambers of the {{w|76th United States Congress}}. The Act revises "the existing nationality laws of the U.S. into a more complete nationality code" and provides details on who is eligible for citizenship via birth, who is eligible for citizenship via naturalization, who is not eligible for citizenship, and how citizenship could be lost or terminated.
|-
| 1940 || || Organizational restructuring || Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS); modern equivalents are USCIS and CBP (and also ICE, though most ICE functions do not exist at the time) || || The Immigration and Naturalization Service is transferred from the Department of Labor to the {{w|United States Department of Justice}} (DOJ), where it would stay for the rest of its life (till early 2003).<ref name=uscis-organizational-timeline/>
|-
| 1943 || || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|Magnuson Act}} becomes law. The Act repeals the Chinese Exclusion Act, but in practice immigration from China is still significantly restricted, as a quota of 105 annual Chinese immigrants is calculated through (flawed) use of the National Origins Formula of the Immigration Act of 1924. || China
|-
| 1945 || December 28 || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|War Brides Act}} is signed into law by President {{w|Harry Truman}} after passing both chambers of the {{w|79th United States Congress}}. The law allows alien spouses, natural children, and adopted children of members of the {{w|United States Armed Forces}}, "if admissible," to enter the U.S. as non-quota immigrants after {{w|World War II}}. This mostly benefits Chinese, whose entry is allowed by the Magnuson Act, but who are subject to strict quotas. The Act would expire on December 31, 1948.
|-
| 1946 || June 29 || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|Alien FiancÃ©es and FiancÃ©s Act of 1946}} is signed into law by President {{w|Harry Truman}} after passing both chambers of the {{w|79th United States Congress}}. It extends the War Brides Act by eliminating barriers for Filipino and Indian war brides. A 1947 amendment would also remove barriers for Korean and Japanese war brides. The Act would expire on December 31, 1948. || Philippines, India (later also Korea, Japan)
|-
| 1946 || July 2 || Legislation || Executive branch || || The {{w|Luceâ€“Celler Act of 1946}} is signed into law by President {{w|Harry Truman}} after passing both chambers of the {{w|79th United States Congress}}. Proposed by Republican {{w|Clare Booth Luce}} and Democrat {{w|Emanuel Celler}} in 1943, the Act allows annual immigration of 100 Filipinos and 100 Indians, and allows people of both nationalities to naturalize. The Act becomes law just two days before Filipino independence; without the Act, Filipino migration would have to stop completely upon Filipino independence. || Philippines, India
|-
| 1952 || June 27 || Legislation (landmark) || Executive branch || A (diplomat), B (business/tourist visitor), C (transit), D (crew), E (treaty trader, investor), F (student), G (foreign government representative), H (temporary worker), I (foreign press) || The {{w|Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952}} becomes law after both chambers of the {{w|82nd United States Congress}} vote to override the veto of President {{W|Harry S. Truman}}. This is the first of two big overhauls of the immigration system (the second being in 1965). Subsequent legislations would often be framed in terms of modifications to this legislation. Among other things, this Act begins the processing of formalizing non-immigrant classifications using letters of the alphabet; title I, section 15 defines the A to I nonimmigrant classifications.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-66/pdf/STATUTE-66-Pg163.pdf|title = Public Law 414: Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952|date = June 27, 1952|accessdate = July 20, 2020}}</ref>

Johnson}} after passing both chambers of the {{w|89th United States Congress}}. The Act would go into effect on June 30, 1968. As of 2020, it is the most recent radical overhaul of the immigration system in the United States. || Differently affects different countries based on their population and existing migration flows
|-
| 1966 || November 2 || Legislation || || || The {{w|Cuban Adjustment Act}} (CAA) is signed into law by President {{w|Lyndon Johnson}} after passing both champbers of the {{w|89th United States Congress}}. The law applies to any native or citizen of Cuba who has been inspected and admitted or paroled into the United States after January 1, 1959 and has been physically present for at least one year; and is admissible to the United States as a permanent resident.
