This page provides a timeline of key events related to immigrant processing and visa policy of the United States. It focuses on laws, policies, and programs affecting pathways for authorized entry to the United States and long-term immigrant and non-immigrant statuses. It is complementary to the [[timeline of immigration enforcement in the United States]].

The programs discussed here mostly come under the purview of the [[wikipedia:United States Citizenship and Immigration Services|United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]], the [[wikipedia:U.S. Customs and Border Protection|U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] Office of Field Operations, and the U.S. Department of State agencies such as the Bureau of Consular Affairs. For the most part, it does ''not'' deal with programs under the purview of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or the United States Border Patrol. There are some exceptions (such as the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, that is under the purview of ICE).

Among other things, the Act allows for the overlooking of unauthorized presence in the United States for people who have been in the queue for permanent residency for a long time. The Act primarily references immigrant processing functions now under USCIS rather than enforcement functions, but also contains some protection from removal proceedings. Specifically, protection from removal proceedings begins ''after'' the Form I-485 (green card application) is filed; people who are eligible for legalization in the future through this Act but are still in the queue may be subject to removal proceedings.<ref name=uscis-green-card>{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/other-ways-get-green-card/green-card-through-legal-immigration-family-equity-life-act|title = Green Card Through the Legal Immigration Family Equity (LIFE) Act|accessdate = February 8, 2016|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}</ref><ref name=procon>{{cite web|url = http://immigration.procon.org/view.answers.php?questionID=000793|title = What Was the 2000 Legal Immigration Family Equity (LIFE) Act?|publisher = [[ProCon.org]]|accessdate = February 8, 2016}}</ref><ref name=uscis-press-release>{{cite web|url = https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/pressrelease/LegalImmigFamEquityAct_122100.pdf|title = Legal Immigration Family Equity Act|date = December 21, 2000|accessdate =  February 9, 2016|publisher = [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]}}</ref>
