==Definition==

'''Transmembrane proteins''' (acronym '''TM''') (also called '''integral polytopic proteins''') are a particular kind of [[integral membrane protein]] attached to the [[lipid bilayer]] in a [[biological membrane]], defined as follows:

Transmembrane proteins are attached across ''both'' the two layers (the inner leaflet and the outer leaflet) of the lipid bilayer. In this, they differ from the [[integral monotopic protein]]s, which are permanently attached to the membrane from only one side.

==Interpretation==

The concept of transmembrane protein can be interpreted at many different levels:

* It can be applied to a specific protein molecule at a specific snapshot of time, if that particular molecule is persistently attached to both sides of a biological membrane. In this framing, you would point to a single molecule that is straddling both sides of the lipid bilayer of a specific biological membrane and say "this is a transmembrane protein."
* It can be applied to a particular protein structure (primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of a specific protein) if molecules with that protein structure occur as transmembrane proteins with respect to some biological membrane.
* It can also be restricted to the context of a specific individual cell or organelle whose biological membrane is being studied, or to a ''type'' of cell or organelle, restricted based on what the organelle is, what kind of species the cells are from, or what type of cells within the species are being looked at. For instance, we might want a list of all the protein structures found as transmembrane proteins in the inner mitochondrial membrane of yeast mitochondria, or in the cell membrane of human skeletal muscle cells, or in the inner chloroplast envelope of the leaves of a particular plant species.
