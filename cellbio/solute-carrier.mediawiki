==Definition==

'''Solute carrier''' is the term used for a [[membrane transport protein]] that transports solutes (ions, small molecules, or macromolecules) across the biological membrane, with each solute transported in only one specific direction (e.g., from inside to outside, or from outside to inside). The direction of transport can be different for different solutes for the same carrier (for instance, [[antiporter]]s carry two solutes in opposite directions).

Solute carriers are classified by family; the classification system is called [[solute carrier family|solute carrier families]].
