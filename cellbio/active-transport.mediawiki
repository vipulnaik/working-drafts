==Definition==

'''Active transport''' refers to the movement of molecules or ions across a [[biological membrane]] against its gradient, i.e., from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration.

There are two kinds of active transport:

* [[Primary active transport]] that uses metabolic energy
* [[Secondary active transport]] that uses an electrochemical gradient
