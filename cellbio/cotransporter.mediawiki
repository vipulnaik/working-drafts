==Definition==

A '''cotransporter''' is a type of [[membrane transport protein]] that facilitates transport across a biological membrane of two species of substrate (ion or molecule) in a coupled fashion: it moves one species along its concentration gradient and the other species opposite its concentration gradient.

Cotransporters stand in contrast with [[uniporters]]: a uniporter transports only one species of substrate.
