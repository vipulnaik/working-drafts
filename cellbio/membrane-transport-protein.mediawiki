==Definition==

A '''membrane transport protein''' is a special kind of [[transmembrane protein]] associated with a [[biological membrane]] that facilitates the movement of one or more of these across the membrane: ions, small molecules, or macromolecules (such as other [[protein]]s). Note that a specific membrane transport protein may facilitate the movement of only a few specific ions across the biological membrane.
