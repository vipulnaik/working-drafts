==Definition==

The term '''membrane protein''' is used for a [[protein]] that interacts with a [[biological membrane]]. Membrane proteins could be one of these:

==Types==

# [[Integral membrane protein]]s -- these are proteins permanently attached to a biological membrane
# [[Peripheral membrane protein]]s -- these are proteins that interact with a biological membrane but are not permanently attached to it
