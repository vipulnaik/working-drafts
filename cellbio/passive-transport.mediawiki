==Definition==

'''Passive transport''' is the movement of ions or molecules across a [[biological membrane]] along the concentration gradient, i.e., from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration.

Passive transport is of four types:

* Diffusion
* [[Facilitated diffusion]]
* Filtration
* Osmosis
