These are some notes as I think about the task of decomposing the
existing "Cold calling" article to make it more compatible with a
broader concept of explainers and learners (rather than instructors
and students).

A few differences to note:

The existing timeline heavily relies on the classroom setting,
including the following aspects:

- Single explainer, multiple learners
- Synchronous setting with a lecture format
- Explainer has authority over the interaction

However, the "essence" of cold calling doesn't need all these
features. In particular, a key feature is the surprise element of when
the learner will be called.

The multiple learner setting is important in determining the proportion of each individual learner getting called to the total amount of time learners are called. The more the learners, the smaller this proportion, and that can have some effects.
