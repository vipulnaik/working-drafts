== Definition ==

A '''demand surface''' is a geometrical construct that is the analogue, for two goods, of the [[demand curve]] for one good. It is ideal for describing situations where the demand for two goods interacts (this could be because they are [[complementary goods]] or [[substitute goods]], but it also allows for more complicated relationships).

Explicitly, suppose <math>A</math>and <math>B</math> are two goods. The demand surface of <math>A</math>and <math>B</math> is a pictorial representation of a function that takes as input the prices of both <math>A</math>and <math>B</math>, and outputs the quantity demanded for both <math>A</math>and <math>B</math>. The demand surface graphs this function in four-dimensional space.

If we denote the prices by <math>p_A</math> and <math>p_B</math> and the quantities by <math>q_A</math> and <math>q_B</math>, the demand surface is the graph of the function:

<math>(p_A, p_B) \mapsto (q_A(p_A, p_B), q_B(p_A, p_B))</math>

The demand surface is two-dimensional and is embedded in four-dimensional space.
