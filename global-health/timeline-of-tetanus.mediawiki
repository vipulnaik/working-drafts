|-
| 1980 < || The [[wikipedia:WHO|World Health Organization]] starts collecting data on diphtheria–pertussis–tetanus (DPT3) vaccination coverage. All regions apart from Americas and Europe are found to have a coverage under 20%. Since then, global coverage of DTP3 vaccination would increase steeply. By 2013 the lowest regional coverage stands at 75% in the WHO African Region and the global average at 86%.<ref name="Tetanus disease and deaths in men reveal need for vaccination"/>

Between 800000 and 1 million deaths due to tetanus are reported each year, of which approximately 400,000 are due to neonatal tetanus. Africa and South East Asia account for 80% of these deaths. Tetanus remains endemic in 90 countries world-wide.<ref name="Clostridium tetani (Tetanus)"/>
