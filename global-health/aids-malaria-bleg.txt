<p>A few months ago, I <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211678488933677">posted to Facebook</a> a puzzle about the difference in funding for AIDS and malaria. Here is the puzzle:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>DAH spending for AIDS is much more than malaria</strong>:&nbsp;Development assistance for health (DAH) numbers from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)&nbsp;<a href="http://ihmeuw.org/426i">show that</a> development assistance spending on AIDS significantly exceeds spending on malaria. For instance, if you click on the link and switch to "Trends" and "Health focus" you'll see that AIDS DAH spending in 2016 was estimated as $9.5 billion whereas malaria DAH spending was estimated as $2.5 billion. Most of this difference comes from government spending (breakdown by source also at the link). In fact, total annual spending by the US government on HIV/AIDS is <a href="http://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/u-s-federal-funding-for-hivaids-trends-over-time/">around $33 billion</a>, more than the National Institutes of Health (NIH) budget, though most of it is domestic spending.</li>
<li><strong>Effective altruists and allied groups have focused much more on malaria than AIDS throughout their history</strong>: Malaria has been identified by GiveWell as a promising area <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2006/12/28/dont-let-elie-rip-you-off/">since 2006</a>, and the Against Malaria Foundation has been a GiveWell top-rated charity <a href="http://www.givewell.org/about/impact">since 2011</a>, excepting one year. Giving What We Can has also recommended the Against Malaria Foundation since before it became a GiveWell top charity, and&nbsp;it has also been the poster boy of effective altruism for fundraising groups like The Life You Can Save and Charity Science. In contrast, HIV/AIDS hasn't been a major focus, with GiveWell getting around to reviewing a HIV/AIDS-related intervention only <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/antiretroviral-therapy-to-treat-hiv-aids">in 2017</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Crude estimates of the toll of the two diseases paints a picture of fairly comparable impact</strong>: Malaria affects five or more times as many people as AIDS. But on the other hand, once you get AIDS, you are stuck with it, whereas you can usually recover from malaria in a few weeks. On the third hand,&nbsp;the agony per unit time of having AIDS is lower than that of malaria. The annual death toll of AIDS is about double that of malaria (a million versus 400,000), though estimates for both have huge error bars.</li>
</ol>
<p>Interestingly the Gates Foundation, which can be considered intermediate between a government donor and an "effective altruist", has an AIDS/malaria spending split in between the two: it spends roughly equally on the two; see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation#Funds_for_grants_in_developing_countries">breakdown of funds for grants in developing countries</a>.</p>
<p>The tension between (1) and (2) is an interesting puzzle. It could be that:</p>
<ul>
<li>DAH spenders are wrong about their focus on AIDS, and in an ideal world would be directing more resources toward malaria.</li>
<li>Effective altruists are wrong about their focus on malaria, and in an ideal world would be directing more resources toward HIV/AIDS.</li>
<li>They are both right "in their own way"; HIV/AIDS spending is the right call to make for DAH spenders whereas malaria spending is the right thing to do for effective altruists. While the most conciliatory to all sides, this also demands the most explanation, since relativism challenges some of the implicit and explicit ideas of effective altruism.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have&nbsp;explored some more specific hypotheses in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vipulnaik.r/posts/10211678551295236?comment_id=10212596422721448">comment on&nbsp;my Facebook post</a>, which I shall not repeat here for brevity.</p>
<p>I've already spent a fair amount of effort collating the history of malaria, including funding a bunch of malaria-related timelines such as <a href="https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_malaria">timeline of malaria</a>, <a href="https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_mosquito_net_distribution">timeline of mosquito net distribution</a>, <a href="https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_The_Global_Fund_to_Fight_AIDS%2C_Tuberculosis_and_Malaria">timeline of the Global Fund</a>, <a href="https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_malaria_vaccine">timeline of malaria vaccine</a>, <a href="https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Against_Malaria_Foundation">timeline of Against Malaria Foundation</a>, and timeline of malaria in <a href="https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_malaria_in_2014">2014</a>, <a href="https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_malaria_in_2015">2015</a>, <a href="https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_malaria_in_2016">2016</a>, and <a href="https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_malaria_in_2017">2017</a>. I intend to spend similar effort on HIV/AIDS, and return to the puzzle after that. However, I'm curious about any thoughts readers here have on the puzzle, including whether you find it interesting, potential resolutions or directions to explore, or refutations of the premises of the puzzle.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to Sebastian Sanchez and Issa Rice for working on the linked timelines. Thanks to Howie Lempel for commenting with thoughts on my original Facebook post. And thanks to IHME for collating Development Assistance for Health (DAH) spending, looking at which inspired this post.</em></p>
