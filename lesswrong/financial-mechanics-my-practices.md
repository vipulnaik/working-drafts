# Financial mechanics: my practices

There's a bunch of discussion of personal finances online, but a lot
of it is geared around how to make, save, and invest money. A lot of
the advice is also geared around and influenced by the need to sell
stuff and encourage consumerism, partly due to things like brand
sponsorships.

One angle to finances that I'd like to see discussed more is financial
mechanics: basic best practices around finances to reduce the
day-to-day overhead of managing finances. In that vein, I decided to
write this blog post to document some of my own practices around
financial mechanics. The set of practices I have chosen has near-zero
financial cost (important!) and very low time cost beyond the initial
setup (also important!). It's also geared heavily toward people who aren't into a lot of "consumerist" stuff, though I think it could be useful to others

I also want to do a separate post talking specifically about my
experience with credit cards and credit scores. So this particular
post doesn't talk much about the "credit" side of things.

## Checking account and checking account drawdown cycle

### What's a checking account?

A checking account, also known as a transactional account or current
account, is an account that is meant to be used for day-to-day
purchases and transactions. Debit cards are tied to checking accounts,
so any payments made with a debit card are debited from the checking
account.

Checking accounts generally offer zero interest rate, though in
regions of high month-over-month inflation they may offer a small
interest rate. Checking accounts may come with fees that might be
waived if a minimum account balance is maintained.

### Two reasons it's important to not have too much money in a checking account

There are two reasons you shouldn't put a lot of money in your
checking account.

1. Money in a checking account is more "exposed": Anybody who gets
   access to your debit card number can defraud you of all the money
   in your checking account. You will likely be able to reverse the
   transactions by calling your bank, but it could still inconvenience
   you.

   Somewhat relatedly, in addition to hackers, your impulsive avatars
   also have easier access to the money in your checking account.

2. Money in a checking account does not earn (much) interest and has a
   very poor return on investment: If you put a significant amount of
   money in your checking account, you're probably forgoing a bunch of
   interest

### Two reasons it's important to not have too little money in a checking account

1. If you have too little money in your checking account, you may not
   have ready access to money for daily life needs or to address
   emergencies. Also, having too little money in your checking account
   may result in an accidental overdraft. Overdrafts can result in
   additional fees.

2. In some cases, there may be minimum account balance requirements
   that require some minimum amount of money in the bank account.

### Suggested drawdown cycle for checking accounts

Below is the approach I follow and my suggestion.

1. Set a goal for a minimum amount of money that you'll keep in your
   checking amount. We'll call this the target minimum balance.

2. If you're paid regularly (e.g., semimonthly), have the payment
   automatically credited to your checking account.

3. Use your checking account to make your payments.

4. If your checking account seems set to go below your minimum before
   your next pay, replenish the money from your savings account or
   another high-yield account.

5. If, *right before* your next pay period, you have more money in
   your checking account than the minimum amount of money, transfer
   the excess amount to an account that yields more (such as a savings
   account, or an index fund).

For instance, let's say you decide that the minimum amount in your
checking account should be $2,000. You start off with $2,000. Let's
say you're paid semimonthly and your semimonthly pay after taxes is
$1,000. So after receiving your pay, your checking account balance is
$2,000 + $1,000 = $3,000. Let's say you spend $250 before your next
pay is due. Then, you have $2,750 right before your next pay is due,
which is $750 over and above the minimum amount. So move that $750 to
a higher-yield account.

If these numbers are consistent month-to-month, your cycle looks like:

$2,000 right before being paid; then $3,000 right after being paid;
then $2,750 after spending money during the pay period; then $2,000
after transferring $750 to a savings account or other high-yield
investment.

If you graph this over time, you'll get a periodic pattern with each
pay period being the period of the cycle, hence the use of the term
"drawdown cycle" to describe this.

Two key measures that emerge from this drawdown cycle, that in turn
can be used to set your thresholds and do any necessary budgeting,
are:

1. What proportion of income do you spend and what proportion do you
   save? In the example above, the income is $1,000, the spent amount
   is $250, and the saved amount is $750. So, spending is 25% of
   income and saving is 75% of income.

   My baseline recommendation: spending should be less than 100% of
   income, or saving should be more than 0% of income. However, this
   only needs to hold true on average, and there may be months where
   spending is more than 100% of income. I'll talk later about how to
   think about large expenses as well as cash versus accrual
   accounting for thinking about large upfront purchases.

   You should probably have more ambitious goals (i.e., spending
   should be significantly less than 100% of income) if you're trying
   to save for the future, and I'll talk a bit more about that as
   well.

2. How does your target minimum balance compare with the spend per
   cycle? The ratio of target minimum balance to spend per cycle gives
   the "runway" in terms of number of cycles. For instance, in this
   case, the runway is $2,000 / $250 = 8 cycles. Multiplying the
   number of cycles by the time duration of each cycle (semimonthly)
   is 4 months. That's how much extra time you have based on just the
   money in your checking account, assumng that you don't get paid
   *and* aren't able to transfer money from another account.

   My baseline recommendation: I suggest having at least 3 months of
   runway as calculated above (i.e., by comparing your target minimum
   balance with your spend). This means that if you suddenly lose your
   job, (and then are very busy looking for another job), *things will
   continue as normal for you without any juggling of money across
   accounts* for about 3 months. Obviously if that actually happens, I
   recommend transferring money from a savings account to your
   checking account.

   Tweak to recommendation if your pay cycle is not regular: If your
   pay cycle is not regular (for instance, you are a freelancer or
   work on commissions) then I suggest runway of 3 months + a few
   months for payment uncertainty. For instance, if your payments tend
   to be delayed up to 2 months, then I suggest that your target
   minimum balance is enough to cover 5 months of spending.

A few good things about the drawdown cycle approach:

* Without a lot of extensive financial tracking, you can get a decent
  sense of your income and expenses.

* The downside risk of forgetting or missing step 5 for a few cycles
  is low: you just keep more money in your checking account and lose
  out on some interest. For instance, in the above example, with
  $1,000 in income and $250 in expenses per (semimonthly) pay period,
  and you forget to transfer the remaining $750 to your savings, and
  this goes on for 4 pay periods, you'll end up with $5,000 in your
  checking account instead of $2,000 after 2 months. You essentially
  lose interest on $3,000 for at most 2 months compared to if you
  remembered properly (and it's actually less because not all the
  $3,000 is for all the 2 months). At a 4% annual rate of interest,
  that works out to at most $20 in lost interest income -- not a lot
  of money.

* The downside risk of forgetting or missing step 4 is also relatively
  low, as long as your spending isn't *wildly* higher than your
  income. For instance, if your earn $1,000 per semimonthly pay
  period, but instead of spending $250 per pay period you spend $1,200
  per pay period. You're effectively losing $200 per semimonthly pay
  period. As long as you continue to get paid regularly, you still
  have a runway of 10 pay periods (5 months) from the point that you
  last have a balnace of $2,000. That's plenty of time to notice that
  you're spending more than your income, and to make up the balance by
  drawing on your savings while you investigate and fix the excess of
  spending.

## Account awareness and monitoring

### Notifications for checking account

It's important to have a robust system of notifications for
transactions on your checking account. Banks generally provide a bunch
of options for notification. Some of the options that may be worth
turning on:

* Balance threshold alerts: Alert if the balance falls below your
  minimum threshold. Receiving such an alert will allow you to
  replenish your checking accout if needed.

* Periodic balance alerts: Send the balance periodically. I've
  configured this to weekly, which is frequent enough that, along with
  the other alerting, I no longer feel the need to regularly log in to
  my account too check my balance. But it's also infrequent enough
  that it doesn't clog my inbox.

* Transaction alerts: Alert for all transactions, or for a subset of
  transactions, based on:

  * Amount of money spent in the transaction: For instance, any
    transaction for more than some threshold, such as $50.

  * Format of the transaction: For instance, for a debit card, it may
    help to notify for card-not-present transactions. That's because
    for card-present transactions, they generally won't happen unless
    you lose your card. On the other hand, card-not-present
    transactions could occur through some leakage of your debit card
    number.

Banks may offer the option of providing the notifications via email,
SMS, or both. Depending on your phone plan, SMS alerts may cost a bit
more; they may also be more disruptive to your workflow. In my case, I
check email way more often than SMS, and my phone plan does impose a
monthly limit on SMS messages (albeit a very generous one) so I've
configured things to send alerts somewhat more generously for email
than for SMS.

### Notifications from sources of income and venues of spending

Payment processors that employers generally use to send payments
should generally email you when they make the payment; you should
check that you receive the email and that the amount is correct and
matches up what you actually receive in your bank. Make sure you're
properly configured to receive these emails; if you only get them at
your work email address, make sure to update the setting to also
receive them at your personal email address. You should also be able
to login to these services and check details of your payments. Make
sure to login at least once a month to make sure your login still
works.

In addition, all places you make online purchases from (such as
Amazon) should send you emails when you place orders with them. In
some cases, even stores where you make physical purchases may allow
you to opt in to email receipts, which is good for keeping a record.

One exception to the rule of emails being sent on each purchase is the
case of fixed-cost subscriptions: fixed-cost monthly subscription
services generally will not send emails at each monthly renewal (in
contrast, *annual* subscription services *will* generally send emails,
as the amounts are larger and they want to make sure you're prepared
for the debit). So for the fixed-cost monthly subscriptions, you have
to just mentally budget for that amount.

### Proactively checking for notifications and comparing paired notifications

One practice I follow is to go check my email inbox and SMSes right
after making an online purchase, or right after getting home from a
physical purchase. I will often have one message from the vendor and
one message from my bank, that I can quickly compare. If I'm expecting
a notification and I don't receive it, I double-check whether I
entered my email address or other contact information correctly.

### How balance monitoring ties up with the drawdown cycle

Steps 4 and 5 of the drawdown cycle talked respectively about topping
up the checking account to the target minimum balance, and siphoning
off the excess in the checking account above the target minimum
balance. The former (step 4) is the more time-sensitive one, as
failing to do this for a sustained period can lead to gradual
depletion of the checking account.

The two suggested alerts I recommended setting up were balance
threshold alerts (set with threshold equal to the target minimum
balance) and periodic balance alerts. Both of these are important to
step 4.

The relevance of the balance threshold alerts to step 4 is obvious:
when you get the balance threshold alert, you immediately know that
you checking account is below its target minimum balance, so you go
online and transfer money from your savings account to your checking
account.

The periodic balance alerts are important mostly because they help you
obtain early warning signs that you might be dropping below the
balance threshold. This might allow you to take preventative steps
(such as disputing an expense, or fixing some bug in your payment
settings for a service).

The periodic balane alerts are also helpful for gently flagging cases
where your balance is too high, which can help you catch if you missed
step 5, and allow you to do it even if a little later.

## Online account security and correctness

### Make sure that your email address, phone number, and mailing address are always correct

Whenever you move, or change your phone number, or change your email
address you should make sure to update the information with your
bank. Also check that you receive the expected notifications by SMS
and email, such as the alerts you've set up, or any other important
account notifications.

### Strong and unique password

I recommend always using a strong and unique password for your bank
account's online login. Be very careful when setting it that you're
setting it to what you intend, and thatit's secure enough and also
something you remember.

### 2-factor authentication

I recommend setting up 2-factor authentication for your bank
account. Make sure to select multiple backup forms of 2-factor
authentication. If you're using SMS-based 2-factor authentication,
then you should make sure prior to travel that you have included a
phone number that is accessible wherever you are traveling to.

## Maintaining records

### Download your monthly statements

I recommend downloading your monthly statements. These statements are
sometimes needed as address proofs, and it's also helpful to have
them. Banks generally don't allow you to access statements older than
a few years, so it's better to download each monthly statement before
you forget.

### Download a CSV of your transactions

Banks often give you the option of downloading a CSV of your
transactions. Here again, they may impose a limit in terms of how far
back you can go. After checking the limit, make sure to download a CSV
at the right cadence so that you don't lose out on any transactions. I
generally download a CSV of all transactions for each calendar year.
