# Trigger-based rapid checklists

In this post, I describe an approach I've been following for the past
few months, and that I feel has been moderately helpful to me:
trigger-based rapid checklists. A trigger-based rapid checklist is a
memorized checklist that I execute rapidly in response to a specific
trigger. I'll explain with examples, and then talk of some of the
general features.

Although this wasn't directly inspired by any specific life hack that
others use, it has some overlap with [trigger-action
planning](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/trigger-action-planning) as
well as with the ideas popularized by [Getting Things
Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done).

## Examples of trigger-based rapid checklists

### Some triggers

I currently have several trigger-based rapid checklists. Here is a
list (not necessarily comprehensive):

* Morning checklist: I execute this after I start using my laptop in
  the morning.

* Night checklist: I execute this right before I plan to close my
  laptop in the evening (this is not right before I go to sleep).

* Pre-outside trip checklist: I execute this right before leaving my
  home for an extended period of time (e.g., for shopping).

* Post-outside trip checklist: I execute this right after returning
  from an outside trip.

* Context switch checklist: I execute this when I'm switching context
  between different kinds of work.

### Sample checklists

Here is a lightly-edited version of my morning checklist:

```
- [ ] (D) Daily update -- review yesterday's daily updates (both personal and work) for any omissions
- [ ] (W) Check the weather for the day
- [ ] (E) Catch up on email: personal and work
  - Also check spam, trash, and all mail (I won't check these for each intermediate check during the day)
- [ ] (M) Catch up on Facebook messages
- [ ] (S) Catch up on Slack: personal and work
- [ ] (C) Calendar checking to plan my day
- [ ] (L) Run the loose ends script
```

And here's a lightly-edited version of my night checklist:

```
- [ ] (D) Daily update -- review today's daily updates (both personal and work) for any omissions
- [ ] (W) Check the weather for the next 1-2 days
- [ ] (E) Catch up on email: personal and work
- [ ] (M) Catch up on Facebook messages
- [ ] (S) Catch up on Slack: personal and work
- [ ] (C) Calendar checking for the next 3 days:
  - For next day, pay particular attention to implications regarding e.g., when to wake up
  - For the two days after that, make sure that the calendar makes sense, e.g., I didn't mark an incorrect event; if there are things that need to be in sync across multiple calendars (e.g., between personal and work calendar) make sure they are in sync
- [ ] (W) Make sure bedroom window and hall terrace door are open
- [ ] (L) Run the loose ends script
- [ ] (C) Close lid and cover laptop
```

## Important features of execution of the checklists

### Trigger-based nature

These checklists are *trigger*-based rather than *time*-based. In
general, I've found time-based things hard to adhere to, since there
can be many sources of variation such as when I wake up or when I go
to sleep. Trigger-based actions are easier to remember, because I just
have to build in my mind the association from the trigger to the
action. The LessWrong [trigger-action planning
tag](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/trigger-action-planning) has a
bunch of great content explaining why trigger-action planning works in
general.

### Written down, but memorized so I usually don't need to reference the written version

Although I have canonical written versions for each checklist, I
memorize all of them to the point that I don't *usually* need to
reference the written checklist when executing it. I may sometimes run
a spot-check against the written version of the checklist, but most of
the times I don't look at it.

The purpose of having a written version is for it to serve as a
canonical reference, and also for it to reflect updates to my
practice. When I decide I'll start or stop doing something, I
respectively add it to, or remove it from, the written checklist.

On the other hand, needing to reference the written checklist gets in
the way of the "rapid" portion of things, so I try to memorize the
checklist.

So far I've found it useful to use mnemonics to memorize the
checklist. To do this, I pick a letter for each checklist item from
which I can expand out the full checklist item. Then I try to arrange
the checklist so that the letters come together nicely to form a good
mnemonic. In the sample checklists I pasted above, I've included the
selected letter for each checklist item in parentheses.

For the morning checklist, the selected letters form the work DWEMSCL,
which doesn't roll too freely off the tongue, but is not too hard to
remember. So every morning, when I open my laptop, I remember
"DWEMSCL", then start executing the expansions of each letter.

### No physical (or digital) checking of boxes

Since I'm interested in rapid execution, I'm willing to trade off
recordkeeping to some extent. So I don't actually check any boxes
anywhere (physically or digitally) as I execute checklist items. Since
many of the items are computer-based, I usually *can* check records of
various sorts (browsing history, terminal history) if my attention
wavers and I want to double-check if I executed a step.

### Checklist redundancy

Given the rapidity of execution, there's some risk that I'll (a)
forget to execute a checklist entirely, or (b) miss executing an item
from the checklist. I've built the checklists in a way that there's
significant redundancy between checklists, so I'd need to miss
something many times before it actually becomes an issue.

For instance, every night I check the weather for the next day, and
then again in the morning I check the weather. Both checks are
valuable: the night-time check could inform my plans for the next day,
including when I wake up. The morning check is helpful for refining
plans, as the weather forecast made in the morning tends to be more
accurate than the weather forecast made overnight.

However, the redundancy between the two reduces the chance that I'll
be completely unaware of any impending major weather development. (In
fact, I also have a weather check in my pre-outside trip checklist,
which offers a third layer of redundancy).

### Detours during checklist execution

Sometimes when I'm executing the morning checklist or night checklist,
one of the checklist items leads to a detour. For instance, when I get
to (E) (email), I might end up replying to or processing some incoming
emails.

The key is to allow for such detours, but still mentally be in
"checklist mode" so that when the detour is open, I return to
checklist execution.

For some checklists, such as the morning checklist, I have set time
limit guidelines (ranging from 45 minutes to 1 hour). For others, no
time limit is necessary, because the very nature of the checklist is
to gate specific other tasks. For instance, if I take a detour during
the night checklist, then I just end up going to sleep later, because
*I'm not going to close my laptop until the rest of the night
checklist is done*.

### Dealing with forgetting

I have each checklist stored in a separate document. In the document,
below the checklist, I record various notes, including notes on
forgetting the checklist execution or forgetting specific
steps. Documenting this helps me observe what I'm missing and why, and
helps me focus on being more reliable on those fronts.
