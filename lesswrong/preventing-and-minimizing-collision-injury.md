# Preventing and minimizing collision injury

Over the past few years, I've been trying to collect a bunch of
principles and ideas around how to prevent and minimize injury. In
this article, I lay out principles centered around injury through
collisions; for instance, falling on the floor, bumping into
something, etc. Collisions cause injury because the kinetic energy of
the colliding objects is rapidly converted to other forms of energy
over a short period of time, resulting in a huge amount of
force. Further, if the force is targeted to a very small surface area,
this also means a huge amount of pressure on the area.

While some of these principles also apply to some aspects of other
kinds of injuries, such as burns, there are additional angles to
avoiding burns, which we don't discuss here.

## Speed

### How speed matters

#### Speed matters for preventing collisions: lower is better

As a general rule, the lower the speed, the less likely a
collision. The simple reason has to do with *stopping time* and
*stopping distance*. In general, there is an upper limit on how fast
you can decelerate. For instance, for brakes in vehicles that run on
wheels, the mechanism of braking is limited by friction, so it's the
coefficient of friction times the acceleration due to gravity.

If your current speed is *v* and your maximum deecleration
(magnitude) is *a* the time it takes you to stop is *v/a*. Therefore,
holding *a* constant, the time it takes you to stop grows linearly
with your speed. So, doubling your speed doubles the time it takes you
to stop.

However, that's not the worst of it. The *distance* it takes you to
stop is *v^2/2a*, so it grows quadratically in your speed. In other
words, doubling your speed, quadruples your stopping distance. In the
context of vehicles, this is also called [braking
distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braking_distance).

Why does stopping distance / braking distance matter? If you see a
brick wall in front of you, braking distance basically answers the
question of how far the brick wall has to be when you start braking,
for you to brake before hitting it.

#### Speed matters for minimizing the impact of collisions: lower is better

Even if a collision does happen, the speed at the time of collision is
crucial in determining the extent of damage. At the extreme, a
collision at literally zero speed creates no injury, and wouldn't even
properly be called a collision!

Mathematically, the kinetic energy (formula *(1/2)mv^2*) is
proportional to the *square* of the speed. So the energy released
during the collision grows quadratically with the speed. Roughly
speaking, therefore, the damage from the collision also grows
quadratically with the speed.

#### When somebody hits you from behind, though, higher speed could be better

While lower is better when you're the one hitting stationary things
(like the ground or a brick wall), higher speed is better when
something is hitting you from behind. For one thing, the higher your
speed, the more likely you are to avoid being hit from behind by
whatever's chasing you. For another, when there's a collision of two
moving objects, it's the relative speeds that matter for the energy
release in the collision.

### How to use the insight that speed matters

* In general, keep low speed to prevent and minimize the impact of
  collisions, except in contexts where there are things behind you
  that could collide with you. In that latter case, make sure to
  maintain a speed similar to the things behind you.

* Reduce speed in the presence of other factors that either increase
  the probability of collisions or increase the impact of collisions
  if they were to happen. We'll talk more about some of these other
  factors later in the article. A few worth mentioning: approaching
  corners or intersections, slippery surfaces (where the coefficient
  of friction is lower, that therefore reduces the deceleration that
  braking can achieve), poor visibility (that reduces the sighting
  distance, thereby reducing the safety margin between sighting
  distance and braking distance).

## Surfaces

### Hard surfaces with poor "give" create more damage from collisions

Consider falling or dropping something on these four kinds of surfaces:

* A mattress
* A carpeted floor
* A hardwood floor
* A sidewalk concrete slab
* A road

For a fall with the same speed, the amount of damage is expected to go
up as you go down this list. Some of these observations are very
obvious.

The fundamental reason for this is that different surfaces have very
different rates at which they slow the falling object to a halt. A
mattress has a lot of give, so it doesn't immediately halt the falling
object; in fact it depresses a little bit giving the objet time and
space to come to a halt. The drop in momentum is therefore spread over
a period of time, so that the peak force is not that high.

The give of a carpeted floor may not be as physically obvious as that
of a mattress, but it's still moderately obvious.

The distinction between hardwood floors and concrete slabs is harder
to see clearly, because in both cases, the time taken is too little
compared to time that humans can explicitly measure.
