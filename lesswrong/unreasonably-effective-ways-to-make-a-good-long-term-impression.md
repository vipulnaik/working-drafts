# Unreasonably effective ways to make a good long-term impression

Over the past few years, in social and professional circles, I've
noticed a few things that seem unreasonably effective in terms of
making a good impression. A lot of the information is based on what
I've seen work in the context of a day job (both at companies I've
worked for and at companies I've interfaced with). To a lesser extent,
I've also drawn of what I've seen in various social circles such as
the effective altruist and rationalist communities.

The four things I've identified are:

* Responsiveness
* Clueyness (being clued-in)
* Reliability and positive affect
* Magic

Along with these, I also talk of various other similar or related
things that I think *aren't* anywhere near as effective.

## Responsiveness

### The mechanism by which responsiveness is unreasonably effective

In my experience, being responsive to the needs and wants of others is
unreasonably effective in getting them to have a high opinion of
you.

In some ways, this can be seen as a downside; people who're working on
deeper, more foundational work that isn't directly responsive to what
people are asking for right now can be at a disadvantage in the
perception game. On the other hand, being responsive can be seen as a
relatively low-risk way of making sure you're at least somewhat
useful.

Roughly speaking, the reason it's *unreasonably effective* is that
when people ask questions or ask for help, they care much more about
whether and how well you address their needs (as opposed to caring in
general about other aspects of your work). This is evidenced by the
*fact that they asked*, i.e., by the fact that they put in the
cognitive and social effort of actually asking.

Concretely, you can try an experiment of this sort (if you have enough
slack to do these kinds of experiments!). For one period (maybe a
week, maybe a month), try to focus on your longer-term tasks,
deprioritizing responding to others quickly. For another period of
similar length, focus on responding quickly, and let your long-term
work suffer to the extent needed for you to be responsive. Get
feedback on what others think of how productive and useful you were in
those two periods.

### Speed as a key element of responsiveness

A simple metric for responsiveness is *how quickly* you respond. This
can be refined a bit to distinguish between time taken to acknowledge
versus time taken to fully address or resolve whatever you're
responding to.
