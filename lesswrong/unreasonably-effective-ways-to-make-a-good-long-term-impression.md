# Unreasonably effective ways to make a good long-term impression

Over the past few years, in social and professional circles, I've
noticed a few things that seem unreasonably effective in terms of
making a good impression. A lot of the information is based on what
I've seen work in the context of a day job (both at companies I've
worked for and at companies I've interfaced with). To a lesser extent,
I've also drawn of what I've seen in various social circles such as
the effective altruist and rationalist communities.

I think things of a similar nature to these are also important in
interpersonal relationships, though I think they may not be quite as
"unreasonably effective" in those contexts.

The jargon of "unreasonably effective" is a riff off of [The
Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural
Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences),
but you don't need to know anything about that to understand this post
(I just copied the term because I like the way it sounds!).

The four things I've identified are:

* Responsiveness
* Clueyness (being clued-in)
* Reliability and positive affect
* Magic

## What I mean by unreasonable effectiveness

When I use the term "unreasonable effectiveness" I am making two
central claims.

### Central claim 1: it's possible to improve on the thing controlling for one's general, domain-specific, and organization-specific knowledge and skills

It would be kind-of-pointless to talk about something being
unreasonably effective if the only way to do that thing were to
improve one's general, domain-specific, and organization-specific
knowledge and skills. If that were the case, the advice could just
boil down to "be better" rather than pointing to some unique area to
focus on.

The things I identify as unreasonably effective are things that can be
focused on and improved separate from this overall stuff. With that
said, each of them requires some baseline level of knowledge and
skills to be applicable. I've ordered my four things in increasing
order of the baseline level of knowledge and skills needed to apply
them. My point here is that once you've achieved that baseline level,
you can get a lot better at the thing by consciously focusing on it
than by just hoping that it'll improve as a side-effect of your
knowledge and skills improving.

### Central claim 2: improving the thing has an outsized return on investment in terms of generating a good long-term impression

This is where the "unreasonably effective" comes in: improving the
thing pays off big time in the perception game, relative to the effort
it took to improve it. I contend this to be true on average for each
of the things; however, it may not be true for everybody for each of
the things!

### Peripheral claim: the unreasonable effectiveness relies on a mix of reasonable effectiveness and exacerbation by human psychology

None of the things I propose are [dark
arts](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/dark-arts); they're all clean and
above board, and even without any significant distortion by human
psychology, these would be effective. Some human cognitive and
emotional biases do contribute to making them *unreasonably*
effective, but even their reasonable effectiveness is good enough to
pay off the effort put into them. So, these are good things to do
anyway; they're just made even better due to human psychology.

## Responsiveness

I'm talking here about responsiveness to messages from others, whether
within the organization, or partners, customers, or vendors, for
things related to one's duties at the organization.

### It is possible to improve on responsiveness controlling for one's overall knowledge and skills (central claim 1)

Knowing more and having more skills generally makes it easier to be
responsive, both by making the specific response easier, and by
allowing one to complete other things faster in order to make way for
the response (i.e., clearing out the higher-priority items in one's
queue). With that context, it may be natural to wonder whether
responsiveness even makes sense as a separate thing to consider from
one's knowledge and skills.

I think the answer is yes; for a given level of knowledge and skills,
it's possible to have a wide variation in one's responsiveness, and
it's possible to deliberately aim for responsiveness at the high
end. I'll talk more about strategies around responsiveness later in
the post, so for now, I'll just tackle the high-level question of why
this isn't already optimized out, i.e., why aren't people as
responsive as they can be given their knowledge and skills?

One reason is the psychological cost of switching, both between tasks
at work (for responding during working hours) and betwen work and
non-work (for responding outside working hours). Relatedly, people
often (mistakenly, in my view) think that by not responding quickly,
they're helping set better boundaries and reducing others' dependence
or demandingness. (I later talk about other strategies one can couple
with responsiveness to address this concern).

### The mechanism by which responsiveness is unreasonably effective (central claim 2)

In my experience, being responsive to the needs and wants of others is
unreasonably effective in getting them to have a high opinion of
you.

In some ways, this can be seen as a downside; people who're working on
deeper, more foundational work that isn't directly responsive to what
other people are asking for right now can be at a disadvantage in the
perception game. On the other hand, being responsive can be seen as a
relatively low-risk way of making sure you're at least somewhat
useful.

Roughly speaking, the reason it's *unreasonably effective* is that
when people ask questions or ask for help, they care much more about
whether and how well you address their needs (as opposed to caring in
general about other aspects of your work). This is evidenced by the
*fact that they asked*, i.e., by the fact that they put in the
cognitive and social effort of actually asking.

### Suggested real-world test, and my own evidence

Concretely, you can try an experiment of this sort (if you have enough
slack to do these kinds of experiments!). For one period (maybe a
week, maybe a month), try to focus on your longer-term tasks,
deprioritizing responding to others quickly. For another period of
similar length, focus on responding quickly, and let your long-term
work suffer to the extent needed for you to be responsive. Get
feedback on what others think of how productive and useful you were in
those two periods.

While I haven't literally done this test, my own evidence comes from a
bunch of historical data about both myself and others, where there was
effectively intertemporal variation in the priority given to
responsiveness. With that said, this is not a purely empirical
finding, but a mix of empirics and extrapolation via common-sense
reasoning. This could be wrong, though, so I encourage you to think
about it and try it in your own context.

### Speed as a key element of responsiveness

A simple metric for responsiveness is *how quickly* you respond. This
can be refined a bit to distinguish between time taken to acknowledge
versus time taken to fully address or resolve whatever you're
responding to.

Speed is important for a few reasons:

* Sometimes, the individual thing is time-sensitive.
* The faster the response, the more iterations of response can happen,
  which means that more can happen overall. For instance, you suggest
  "can you try X?" and they come back with "I tried X, and Y happened"
  and then you respond "ok it looks like the issue is Z"; the times
  taken for each response iteration add up.
* There's a psychological benefit of immediacy of response in terms of
  reducing the need for the person asking the question to switch back
  context; when somebody asks a question or asks for something, the
  material is fresh in their mind, and it fades out quickly going
  farther.

There's some nuance on whether it's worthwhile to send a message to
acknowledge a question or request, versus just wait and send a more
substantive response or resolution. My general sense is that if the
person asking does not already have experience with you being
responsive, it is good to acknowledge and thereby reassure them that
you're on it.

However, in cases where the person already has experience with you
being responsive, and/or has visibility in other ways to have a
reasonable sense that you're on it, it may not be necessary to
acknowledge. In some cases, it may even be a bad idea to send an
information-free acknowledgement, insofar as it adds to the other
person's notification load and ultimately doesn't give them new
information. Overall, this is a trade-off that would need to be
navigated based on the type of environment and relationship, but if in
doubt, my suggestion would be to err on the side of a speedy
acknowledgement.

### Responsiveness to directed versus undirected messages

When a message is addressed directly and specifically to you,
responding to it becomes a requirement of sorts. In this kind of
situation, not responding at all can earn you negative
credibility. Responding adequately keeps you at baseline (without
improving things) whereas responding better than baseline can give you
a leg up in the perception game.

On the other hand, in the case of *undirected* messages, for instance,
questions posed in a mailing list or a Slack channel, the baseline of
not responding is close to zero effect, so *any helpful response at
all* (and in some cases, even a response that turns out to not have
been useful but shows that you made a good-faith effort to help) can
help your perception. Opportunities of this kind abound in many
technology organizations that use tools like Slack; just look around
at the Slack channels, locate open-ended questions that don't yet have
engagement, that seem particularly important or time-sensitive, and
that are a good fit for your skills, and jump on them! In the context
of Slack channels that have a large number of members, your
responsiveness improves your perception not just with the person
asking the question, but with others who are following happenings in
the channel.

Similarly, if there are GitHub issues (or issues in the project
management tool you use, such as Jira) that people have opened a while
back, that seem important to them, and would be quick to do, but that
aren't getting picked up by the prioritization process, picking them
up could help in the perception game (but make sure not to run afoul
of prioritization policies of your organization if they strictly
discourage such discretionary issue-picking).

There are two obvious caveats when tackling undirected messages:

* If you are clearly behind on important deliverables (including
  addressing directed messages), then replying to undirected messages
  can raise flags about your prioritization skills, and therefore hurt
  you in the perception game. So make sure that you're on top of your
  deliverables and the directed messages before jumping on undirected
  messages.

* When submitting contributions to undirected messages, you want to
  make sure your contribution satisfies a minimum standard of quality,
  because by responding, you may be displacing others who could have
  spent effort responding. If you respond with something that seems
  correct but turns out to be wrong, you've done worse than if you had
  just stayed silent and let somebody else respond. This is more of an
  issue with undirected messages than with directed messages, because
  with directed messages, the person directing the message at you has
  already *chosen you* to make the effort.

  Relatedly, once you start submitting partial responses to an
  undirected message, others who may have otherwise organically
  started addressing it may be dissuaded, so if you later stop
  focusing on it, you may have "orphaned" the original message.

  So, before submitting your first response, make sure you know what
  you're saying well enough that it's not misleading and won't
  displace others' efforts, and that you're not leading others on in
  terms of the additional effort you're willing to put in.

### Frequent monitoring

Given the importance of speed, it's important to frequently monitor
for incoming messages and to make sure you're available for emergency
forms of contact. The details of this can vary from situation to
situation.

One thing to remember is that frequent monitoring doesn't equate to
immediate response; you can look at a message and decide "this isn't
urgent enough to merit a response now; I'll respond later." As long as
you have a good system of reminders (something supported through
software in many ways, ranging from Slack reminders to calendar
reminders to a plethora of reminder apps) this doesn't put you at a
disadvantage relative to reading the message later.

For myself, I use [trigger-based rapid
checklists](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9B2zFwN5iepkC9LqJ/trigger-based-rapid-checklists)
whereby I check various sources of messages at various triggers,
including in the morning after waking up, at night before going to
sleep,, and at various points in between, including before going out
and after returning, or before and after meals. I keep it simple: I
aim to check all sources of messages at each trigger, including
checking work-related sources of messages even on days that I'm not
working. In most cases, the volume of messages is small enough and
almost none of them need immediate action; in some cases, quick action
can be undertaken to address them. In a few rare cases, it doesn't
make sense to respond (for instance, something requiring a complex
response that I read right before going to sleep) so I set a reminder
for myself to get to it later, and if needed, I send a quick
acknowledgement.

### The concern about setting unrealistic expectations through very good responsiveness

I've heard people voice a potential downside of very good
responsiveness: it sets unrealistic expectations that your responses
will continue to be comparatively good, and this may not be
sustainable. The two forms in which I've most often heard this concern
are:

* Speed of response: For instance, if for a few weeks you respond to
  incoming messages within minutes, people asking for your response
  may expect that you will continue to do so, and so they may feel
  more disappointed when your response latency goes up from minutes to
  hours. Whereas if you took a day to respond in the past, they won't
  be disappointed if you respond within hours.

* Working hours: For instance, if somebody is reaching out frequently
  outside working hours, and you respond quickly even outside working
  hours, that might create the expectation that you will continue to
  respond outside working hours.

While I think this concern is valid to some extent, I think there are
relatively easy ways to address it, and in my personal experience,
both as a responder and somebody making requests, these have worked
reasonably well.

#### Apologize or explain yourself only when you fail to meet the baseline expectations, not when you fall short of your elevated responsiveness

You should have a reasonably clear picture of the distinction between
the *baseline* expectations around how quickly others should expect to
respond, versus your own goal of elevated responsiveness that you try
to adhere to where feasible. And you should *not* explain yourself as
long as you are above the baseline expectations, even if you fall
short of your elevated goals. Apologies or explanations influence the
other person's mental model of what they are owed, more than what you
actually do. Here are some examples:

* Speed of response: For instance, if you often reply within minutes,
  but one day you took an hour to respond, and the baseline
  expectation is that you should respond within a day, then *don't
  apologize or explain yourself* for taking an hour to respond.

* Working hours: For instance, if somebody reached out to you twice
  outside working hours, and you responded immediately once, but the
  other time you only responded at the start of working hours, you
  don't need to apologize or explain yourself for the second time. If
  you think they *aren't* aware of the working hours, you should try
  to make sure they're aware, perhaps by mentioning it somewhere
  unobtrusively, or (for instance if you're responding through a
  ticketing system) through an auto-responder in the ticketing system.

#### Flag cases where you think the other person might be taking undue risk by relying on your responsiveness

Sometimes, people may build your responsiveness as an assumption into
their own plans, to their detriment and yours. In particular:

* Speed of response: Somebody may make a plan to do something with
  some level of risk, with the expectation that you'll be available to
  respond quickly if something goes wrong.

  Flag this if it happens, and perhaps even preempt this, by
  encouraging people to reach out proactively when doing something
  potentially risky. The proactive reachout could help reduce risk in
  various ways: you may be able to see a preview and vet it before the
  change goes "live", or you may be able to coordinate a time that you
  can be sure to be available to monitor for issues.

  If something goes unexpectedly wrong, and you are available to
  respond quickly, it's best to respond, rather than hold your
  response hostage. But if you see predictable patterns where people
  were relying on your responsiveness rather than planning and
  coordinating with you, flag this.

* Working hours: If somebody is doing particularly risky things
  outside of your working hours, with the expectation that you'll be
  responsive, flag this. Remind them of your working hours and ask
  that risky things that may require your input be done within your
  working hours.

#### The 75% heuristic

While the previous two techniques seem to work reasonably well,
another heuristic that you can use to reduce the risk of implicitly
creating unrealistic expectations with somebody you have a lot of
repeat interactions is what I call the "75% heuristic", namely, aim
for about 75% of your interactions to meet your elevated standards of
responsiveness, and for the remaining 25%, aim to stay above baseline
levels of responsiveness, but below the elevated levels. People are
relatively less likely to start relying on or expecting a level of
responsiveness that they only receive 75% of the time.

If delivering elevated responsiveness 75% of the time feels too
burdensome, then there are likely other structural issues, such as too
much workload, not enough skill or competence, or too much other stuff
going on in life. My general sense is that absent these factors, a 75%
target gives enough room for a reasonable frequency of things coming
up and juggling other priorities.

### Making sure each message-sender has a positive impression of your responsiveness

While from your perspective, you might think of your responsiveness in
terms of all responses you provide to *all* message-senders, an
individual message-sender may only have visibility into your
responsiveness to *that person's messages*. To win the perception
game, it is therefore particularly important to be responsive to
message-senders for whom (a) you have previously been unresponsive, or
(b) you haven't yet had the opportunity to demonstrate your
responsiveness. In the language of the 75% heuristic above, it's
better to apply the 75% heuristic at the level of each message-sender
rather than globally. If *everybody* thinks you are at that 75% level,
that's better than some finding you at 100% and others finding you at
50%. With that said, there may also be other dynamics at play, such as
your reporting relationship and power structures, so you may have to
factor those in when prioritizing what to respond to.

### Proactive isn't as unreasonably effective as responsive

Personally, I think being proactive is even better than being
responsive. Whereas responsive is about addressing wants and needs
once they are articulated, proactive is about getting in front of
issues before they arise.

Even though I think this, I also think that being proactive, while
definitely appreciated, isn't as unreasonably effective as being
responsive. Roughly speaking, the reason is that the true value-add of
your proactive behavior is unclear to others. By nipping a problem
early in the bud, you prevent people from seeing how big the problem
could have become. In contrast, responsiveness is in a context where
the person making the request has already decided that the problem is
worth solving.

So, while I encourage you to be proactive, keep in mind that being
responsive will be way more unreasonably effective by default. If you
want to gain appreciation for being proactive, it's important to
increase the chances that the other side understands why you're being
proactive and what's at stake.

## Clueyness (being clued-in)

One thing I've noticed is that people who seem to "get it" quickly
seem to do very well in the perception game. Since this is the
opposite of what's commonly called cluelessness, I'm calling this
clueyness, for lack of a better term; this doesn't quite match [Urban
Dictionary's
definitions](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Cluey),
but I think it gets at the heart of it.

### What I've noticed of clueless people

I know of a few cases of people who are generally reasonably competent
at their work; they have the mix of skills and conscientiousness that
should destine them for a decent degree of professional success. And
yet, in various contexts, they come across as clueless. Judging from
my limited sample size, these people tend to get shuttled from team to
team or company to company, without landing firmly anywhere. Nobody thinks
super-negatively of them; they're not the sort of person whom you'd
want to fire, but they do tend to be the sort of person who'd get laid
off when times are tough.

### It is possible to improve on clueyness controlling for one's overall knowledge and skills (central claim 1)

It's a bit hard to tease out the cluelessness aspect from other
aspects of one's skills. Obviously, somebody who is better at
cognitive tasks, who has more skills and experience, or who is more
emotionally or socially intelligent, will tend to be more clued in. So
one criticism of this idea of clueyness is that, far from being an
unreasonably effective thing one can actively choose, it's just a
blend of general skills.

However, judging from the examples I know of clueless people, one
trait that comes to my mind is that they are particularly bad at even
*trying* their hand at perspective-taking, i.e., at putting themselves
within the shoes of another party, with the goals and constraints of
that other party. Perspective-taking is somewhat related to empathy,
but isn't quite the same: empathy focuses on the emotional aspects and
perspective-taking focuses on the cognitive aspect. The thing I've
noticed about clueless people is not so much that they're bad at
perspective-taking, but it seems that they don't even have it on their
radar to try to do so, instead hoping that the world just works out
fine from their own perspective.

This suggests to me that there could be some relatively easy gains
toward clueyness from trying to do perspective-taking, without a
radical improvement to one's knowledge and skills. I talk about this a
little further down, but before that, let me justify central claim 2.

### The mechanism by which clueyness is unreasonably effective (central claim 2)

Why might being cluey be *unreasonably effective*? Mostly because
people generally don't like having to struggle or fight to explain
themselves / be understood. There are definitely cases where people
like being in a role of explainer/teacher/mentor, and so you being
ignorant of something may give them the opportunity to take on that
role, *but* even in those cases, you actually being slow on the
uptake, or difficult to get ideas across to, is worse than you being
receptive and a pleasure to explain things to.

The feeling of "having to struggle to get a point across" can leave a
lasting impression in people's mind, well beyond the actual time
investment (which is compounded if the experience is not just
cognitively but also emotionally frictionful, but even without
emotional conflict, it is stressful). To see this, imagine you have a
meeting where you're trying to assign a task to somebody that you
thought would take five minutes to explain, but then when you start
explaining you realize the other person is missing a lot of background
knowledge and you end up spending twenty minutes on it. That's just an
extra fifteen minutes on it, which might still be small relative to
your work day, but it will leave a distinct impression on you about
where the other person is and how clued-in they are.

### How to be cluey: the short version

Reversing my observations about clueless people, my main suggestion
for how to be cluey is to try taking a variety of perspectives
routinely. One important aspect of perspective-taking is that you get
much better results doing it over time, collecting data gradually,
rather than trying to do it only at the last minute when you are in a
situation where you need to figure out how to navigate it. So, start
your perspective-taking exercise when there's no crisis to address. Do
a suitable mix of thought experiments, asking people questions, making
predictions and seeing how they pan out. The reason a mix is needed is
because each method has its strengths and limitations. For instance,
thought experiments can help you get started, but they can also lead
you astray because you're limited by your own experiences (and subject
to things such as [typical mind
fallacy](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/typical-mind-fallacy/history)). Asking
people questions can reveal variables and considerations that you
wouldn't have thought abourt yourself, but people may not be fully
frank about how they're thinking. A lot of the [negotiation techniques
I described in my Chris Voss MasterClass
review](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CRAzG386t3suSqDgd/chris-voss-negotiation-masterclass-review#Negotiation_techniques)
are designed to elicit this sort of information and help you become
more cluey.

### Being cluey about goals

It's important to be cluey both about *how to do things* and *what
we're trying to do*. The former tends to get emphasized more in
general, just as a matter of course: when we think about skills, we
are naturally focused on the aspect of *how* to do things. For
instance, we think about mastering tools, technologies, languages,
concepts, etc. To som extent, this makes sense, because of lot of the
how-to (the know*how*) can help across a wide range of goals.

However, the net effect of the focus on *how* is that there's a lot
more "low-hanging fruit" to pluck with respect to being cluey about
the *what we're trying to do* part. In other words, it's likely to pay
off more to be cluey about goals, even holding one's knowhow / skills
constant.

#### The clueless approach to goals

I've noticed a lot of technically competent people who are very
clueless about goals; when asked why they're doing something, they may
simply say something like "this was assigned to me" or "I was told to
do this" versus having a story about the chain of impact from their
action to things that matter. On the other hand, the people I'd think
of as cluey have a strong pulse on the goals; they can articulate a
story like "doing A leads to B leads to C, which we think might lead
to D though we're not sure." This doesn't preclude the possibility
that in some cases, you may do a thing simply to please another
person, because of the karmic benefits it confers to you, even though
you think it's otherwise useless (or have uncertainty on its value
otherwise). Even so, believing this to be true in some cases is
different from just not having an opinion or story at all on why it
matters (or why it is believed by others to matter).

#### Ask about goals, but with care

As a first pass, it's better to ask about goals if they aren't clear
to you (or even if you think they're clear to you, but want to
confirm). However, asking too much about goals that you should already
know can expose your cluelessness. So ask a little bit, but if you
feel like you're revealing a lot of cluelessness, think about
selecting an environment and context for information-gathering where
you can patch your cluelessness without putting it on display or using
up a lot of people's time.

For instance, if you're in a group meeting and are discussing the
rationale for a task assigned to you, and you get into a multi-step
discussion about why it's worthwhile, take the discussion offline
rather than wasting the group's time. And, if you feel like you're
going through the same set of questions about goals that you've
already asked and received answers to, stop and go recall the result
of the original discussion, to identify exactly what parts you are
still unclear about.

### Being cluey about your own evaluation

Being clued-in about how you're perceived is important (though it's
not the only part of being cluey!).

#### Taking the perspective of the person (or persons) you report to

In a formal organizational structure, you usually report to somebody
(unless you're the CEO). In some organizational structures, you may
report to two or three people. The person you report to may not be the
only stakeholder in your work, but usually that is the person who
aggregates the information around your performance. So being able to
take the perspective of this person is important.

This is particularly easy if you also have other people reporting to
*you* at the same organization or similar organizations. Most likely,
the frameworks and rubrics that this person has been given by the
organization to evaluate you are similar to the frameworks and rubrics
you have been given to evaluate the people who're reporting to you. If
that's the case, then drawing upon your own experience with the
frameworks, and then applying them to your own knowledge about
yourself, can help you get started.

Beyond the formal frameworks, there are also informal indicators that
you can observe yourself using to evaluate the people who report to
you, or that you can see the person your report to applying to you or
others who report to that person. Just try transporting those
indicators to yourself and see how you stack up.

One area where people may openly discuss their evaluation of others
is the context of hiring. So being in hiring conversations can give
you some insight into how people evaluate others. With that said, the
amount and nature of information on a potential hire differs a lot
from the amount and nature of information on somebody already working,
so the value here is limited.

#### Taking the cost-benefit perspective

This one can be hard for people, particularly people whose jobs are
not generally framed in terms of cost vs. revenue. It can also be a
bit scary to think about. But it's worth dipping your toe in this at
least a little bit.

Namely, think about what you're costing the organization and what
value you're bringing to the organization. Imagine somebody was
dispassionately tallying up the costs and comparing them to the
benefits. Does this person see a clear case that you're generating
more value than you cost? If not, is there information you can present
to this person showing what you've already done, that would make a
clear case. If the answer to even that is no, you should be
concerned. I'd say flag this to the person you report to, and see if
they can convince you that you're creating more value than you
cost. If not, consider yourself a potential candidate for the next
reduction-in-force or layoff (which may not happen for a long time,
but it's always a risk).

## Reliability and positive affect

Reliability and positive affect, as I'm using the terms, refer to a
cluster of related ideas:

* People feel like if they give you a task, they "don't have to worry
  about it" any more. You'll do the best that can reasonably be done,
  and will reach out to them if needed, so they don't have to nag you
  or remind you or monitor you to make sure you're doing it.

* People feel a sense of a relief when you "walk into the room" during
  a stressful time. For instance, if you and your teammates and
  handling a shop floor, and there are a lot of customers, then when
  you sign in to work, your co-workers feel a sense of relief that
  you're there and things will now improve.

If you can generate a justified perception of reliability and your
presence creates positive affect in the above sense, this helps a lot
in the perception game. I think this is unreasonably effective,
compared to, for instance, being a high-variance worker who still
accomplishes the same average output.

Let's drill down into this more systematically using the two central
claims.

### It is possible to improve on reliability and positive affect controlling for one's overall knowledge and skills (central claim 1)

Obviously, having more knowledge and skills can help with
reliability. In order to reliably do a task, having the skill to do it
faster or better helps! But there are some dimensions of reliability
that can be improved for a given level of knowledge and skills, as
long as the knowledge and skills are above a baseline where it is
*possible* to do the task.

One big aspect of reliability is "showing up" which means more than
just physically showing up or clocking in on a timer app. What exactly
is entailed by showing up can differ a lot from job to job; here are
two broad categories:

* For some jobs, showing up means being around and available for
  specific time periods, and having the willingness to
  enthusiastically perform some (relatively easy) work over that time
  period as it arises. Think of a job on a retail floor. You show up
  to do the job, and then you do whatever is in front of you, whether
  it's stocking shelves or helping customers check out.

* For some jobs, things are more "spiky" so showing up means being
  prepared to ramp up the intensity and focus at short notice when a
  problem arises (while also having some aspects of the previous point
  of just being around for other things). Think of something like an
  emergency responder who may have a quiet day without a lot to do,
  and then suddenly have to jump into action to engage in life-saving
  care.

My general impression is that a lot of jobs involve a mix of these
two, and both are important, but the latter tends to be underestimated
by people. Showing up for spiky activities is closely related to
"responsiveness" that I described earlier, but it's still different
enough that I broke it down separately. I'll say a bit more about this
further down, but for now let me proceed to central claim 2.

### The mechanism by which reliability is unreasonably effective (central claim 2)

The reason reliability and positive affect are particularly effective
compared to, say, being an eccentric high-variance worker who does
great stuff randomly, is that of letting other people relax with the
feeling that they're in "good hands". Generally, people dislike having
to monitor other people, and prefer other people who subjectively
*reduce* their workload rather than increasing it. By being reliable
at doing background tasks and spiky tasks, you meaningfully help
people relax.

## Magic

This is probably the hardest to achieve, and the one that I'd focus on
least; if there were a choice between "reliability and positive
affect" and "magic" I'd recommend the former. Nonetheless, if you've
already exhausted responsiveness, clueyness, and reliability and
positive affect, then magic can help you get ahead.

What do I mean by magic? Roughly speaking, I'm talking about when you
take some seemingly-intractable problem and just solve it, or you come
up with some crazy idea that improves things a lot, that nobody else
has thought of or would have expected to think of. If you can
*reliably* do magic, that's of course great, but even if can do magic
a few times a year, that is unreasonably effective at winning the
perception game.

### It is possible to improve on magic controlling for one's overall knowledge and skills (central claim 1) aka mere mortals can do magic

One pushback to the idea of magic is that being able to do magic
requires a crazy high level of skill, acquiring which is very hard to
begin with, so magic isn't an accessible strategy in the first place.

This is probably true in many cases, but I also think that there are
other cases where magic can be achieved by just persisting on a
problem for a long time (using the more general skill of stamina)
along with a relatively basic toolkit. So, if you have good stamina,
access to a basic toolkit, and a willingness to use these on
seemingly-intractable problems if and when they come up, you have a good
likelihood of succeeding at least some of the time.

What makes magic hard? A bunch of things:

* Seemingly-intractable problems may not happen all that often, so if
  you want to get the perception benefits of doing magic, you need to
  have the willingness to jump on these problems when they happen,
  which may not be at a time that is otherwise convenient for
  you. They're not a good fit if you are generally behind in terms of
  meeting your core responsibilities.

* Seemingly-intractable problems are generally not easy! You often
  need to know the basic problem-solving toolkit of your domain
  reasonably well.

* Seemingly-intractable problems can often be brute-forced, but the
  process is painful and long. So absent a stroke of good luck or
  extreme skill that helps you identify a core insight quickly, you
  need to be prepared to slog through the process. Moreover, the huge
  amount of local context in the problem-solving process means that
  these usually require a concentrated stretch of time.

In the world of programming, many seemingly-intractable problems can
be brute-forced by some mix of [stepping in a
debugger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepping_(debugging)), adding
copious log lines, and trying several times with enough variation to
conditions. In fact, I'd say that most front-end problems in browsers
(tied to JavaScript execution) that can semi-reliably be locally
replicated can be solved with these (with some binary searching when
operating over large possibility spaces) and some basic programming
knowledge. But this process can be very painful. The final takeaway
looks neat and simple, but the discovery process is ugly because there
is a lot of code to go through and I don't have access to the source
code to understand the original structure.

This is an area where doing things like competition-level
problem-solving (such as Olympiads) is disproportionately helpful,
even after controlling for overall effects on cognitive
skills. Competition-level problems involve a lot of "brute-force
through a basic toolkit, with some speeding up if you get a core
insight quickly"; the real-world problems tend to have fewer cases
where the core insight can be located through good aesthetics, but the
feel is otherwise very similar.

### The mechanism by which magic is unreasonably effective (central claim 2)

Given how painful magic is, a natural question is: is its
effectiveness unreasonably high *relative* to the pain? I think for
many people, yes. In many cases, the duration of the pain is high
enough to deter most people (thereby creating an opportunity) but
usually not high enough to create lasting damage, but it does create a
good long-term impression. [Schlep
