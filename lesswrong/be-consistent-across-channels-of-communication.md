# Be consistent across channels of communication

You may have heard of the [7-38-55
rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Mehrabian#Attitudes_and_congruence)
that Albert Mehrabian came up: receivers pay importance to words, tone
of voice, and facial expression in the 7:38:55 ratio when
feelings/emotions are being communicated.

While the exact proportions are up for debate, and probably differ in
different kinds of communications, it seems clear that there are
multiple channels through which we communicate. In the case of
face-to-face communication, these include our words, tone of voice,
and facial expressions. For communication on a messaging app, these
may include our words, punctuation, emojis, and even how long we take
when replying to messages. Even within words, there can be many layers
of communication.

Different channels of communication can often send contradictory
messages. My claim in this post is a seemingly simple one: you should
try as much as possible to be consistent in what you communicate
through all your channels, and this should match what you *intend* to
communicate. While this might seem so obvious as to not even deserve a
post, it is in fact contrary to a lot of human practice, so my
assertion is in fact at least somewhat nontrivial.

## What's true, what you want to communicate, what you attempt to communicate, and what you actually communicate

I draw a distinction between these three things:

1. What's true to the best of your knowledge
2. What you want/seek to communicate
3. What you attempt to communicate through various channels (words, tone of voice, body language)
4. What you actually communicate through various channels

We can think of a logical flow from (1) to (2) to (3) to (4), insofar
as this reflects the chronological sequence.

This post is mainly the assertion that (2) should match (3) for *all*
channels of communication. However, I'll also talk a bit about the
rest of the pieces in this post. For now, a quick note:

* The relation between (1) and (2) is essentially the idea of
  "honesty"; if (2) doesn't match (1), then you may not be being fully
  honest.
* The relation between (3) and (4) depends on your extent of mastery
  of the channels of communication as well as the extent to which
  inner conflicts/confusions within you cause mixed messages.

I'll talk more about these later in the post.

But for now, the main focus of this post is on the relation between
(2) and (3). The claim is that what you *attempt* to communicate
through each channel should match what you *want* to communicate.

## What it means to attempt to communicate something different from what you want to communicate

I'll start with Jeff Kaufman's [tickling post](https://www.jefftk.com/p/tickling):

This is a great example where the child who *wanted* to be tickled
attempted to use the verbal channel of communication to say the
opposite ("no" to wanting to be tickled). The child used a nonverbal
channel (giggling) to communicate wanting to be tickled.

Reasons: Mischief? Embarrassment? Shyness? Modesty?

## Why it's a bad idea to attempt to communicate what's different from what you want to communicate

### Significant risk of being misunderstood

Jeff Kaufman hints at this in his tickling post.

### Greater cognitive cost / stress imposed on the other party

Your counterpart is left trying to make judgment calls about what you
really mean. And they could get it wrong. This could be significant in
various ways.

### Risk of it affecting how others perceive your words in general

If you do this in one context, then others might think you're doing it
in another context -- thereby misinterpreting your words and actions
even when you're trying to be clear.

## How to deal with broadcasting effectively inconsistent communication

What if your connection from (3) to (4) is poor? For instance:

* Maybe your speech, natural facial expression, or body language are
  such that people often interpret them a particular way, so you
  unintentionally communicate something you didn't intend to.

* Maybe you unintentionally communicate the wrong thing because of
  something else going on in your life (e.g., you are stressed about
  another issue).

### Improve your control over specific channels of communication

For instance, acquire better mastery over your words, practice your
tone of voice, get better at your facial expressions and body
language.

### Reduce the use of unreliable channels of communication

If some channels of communication tend to misfire, eliminate them in
your communication. For instance, if your facial expressions often
communicate the opposite of what you want them to communicate, then
consider using means of communication (such as phone or written
communication) that don't show your face. If your written
communication tends to be full of spelling and grammar errors that
convey the wrong impression, consider focusing on oral communication
instead.

### Give others guidance on what channel of yours to pay attention to

Pick a channel that you are most reliable with, and tell others that
they should pay attention only to that channel, not to any seemingly
contradictory messages arising from other channels. You can also
mention any issues you have with other channels. For instance, you can
mention that you have social shyness and can't easily maintain eye
contact, which might convey the impression that you've got something
to hide, but the other party should ignore that and focus on your
words.

### Be part of communities that share the same preferences in terms of channels of communication

If you're into written communication, be part of communities that
focus on written communication.

## Interpreting inconsistent communication from others

### Seek clarification

If you're getting opposite messages from somebody's words and tone of
voice, don't just assume that either one is correct -- *seek
clarification*. This reduces the risk of you acting based on wrong
information, and it also highlights to the other person that they
communicated inconsistently; they might have done this without even
being aware (a breakdown from (3) to (4) on their end).

### If clarification doesn't clarify, go with the more explicitly controlled channel

Written or oral communication channels are more explicitly ontrolled,
so give them preference. Even if this is *less* likely to be correct,
it's more defensible. if you go with somebody's tone of voice rather
than words, they can later claim that you did the opposite of what
they wanted you to do. But if you go with their words, it's less
defensible for them to claim that.

## Asides

### No means no

We can think of the "no means no" / "yes means yes" movements in the context of sexual consent as applying some of these ideas to sexual interactions (though there's a lot more going on there).
