In this document, I attempt to discuss the impact of the coronavirus
lockdown and how to prepare for it. This is not focused on the direct
impact of coronavirus, but rather on the secondary impact of
precautions that people are taking.

I'll try to update this regularly for the next few weeks, but please
keep in mind that the document may get out of date on specifics.

## A note on lockdown timeline

Based on current trends in coronavirus cases and the impact of
existing lockdowns, I expect that "shelter in place" orders (such as
[San Francisco's](https://sf.gov/stay-home-except-essential-needs), or
social pressure to do the equivalent, will last till:

* At least April 28: Greater than 75%
* At least May 19: Greater than 45%
* At least June 9: Greater than 30%
* At least June 30: Greater than 20%
* At least September 30: Greater than 10%

I am giving lower bounds on probabilities rather than point estimates
of probabilities, because I don't feel confident enough to give point
estimates, and also because getting precise probability estimates
isn't as important as getting lower bounds that are good enough to
drive specific decisions.

I won't go into details of how I came up with these estimates, but
it's a result of a mix of various factors, including close monitoring
of coronavirus statistics (from the Wikipedia pages), as well as
reading Bill Gates' prediction that [if done right, the lockdown could
last 6 to 10
weeks](https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-coronavirus-shut-downs-done-well-last-6-10-weeks-2020-3).

I expect that many readers on LessWrong will consider these lower
bounds very conservative. They're probably right, but even these
conservative bounds are good enough for my purposes.

Even after the orders are lifted, it is quite likely that it won't be
a good idea to venture out, for personal safety reasons, if you can
avoid it.

## General principles

* Brace for a 2-3 month timeline for the lockdown, with the
  possibility of a 6-month lockdown.

* With that in mind, consciously brace for this, adjust, and plan
  accordingly.

* Keep a buffer, but don't engage in panic buying.

## Impact on social life

Staying at home, and refraining from participating in social
activities, is something that could get harder and harder as the time
period gets longer. Some social activities are easy to forgo for a
week, but harder to forgo for two months. I expect that this could
lead to people feeling depression, loneliness, and mental health
issues, with the risks increasing the longer this continues.

A silver lining is that the reduced level of necessary activity, in
particular commuting, may help people recover from months or even
years of hectic commutes.

The balance of these factors will vary from person to person, but I
expect that for most people, the social life impact will be a net
negative.

What can we do? Here are a few thoughts:

* Brace for impact! It's important to psychologically prepare for the
  idea that you may have to shelter in place for at least another
  month, and possibly two or three or even more months.

* Exploit the positives: You can't do some social activities that you
  normally do, but perhaps the shelter-in-place and the saved commute
  time gives you more flexibility and time to do some other things
  you've always wanted to do but never had the bandwidth for. For
  instance, maybe you can spend evenings working on a long-deferred
  personal project, or learn a new skill, instead of being stuck in
  the commute.

* Strike the right balance in terms of going out: It's reasonably safe
  to go out if you stay far from people and don't touch stuff. So,
  make sure to get a reasonable amount of exercise and fresh
  air. Don't stay cooped up in your home for days. (Obviously,
  exceptions apply for people who are sick or may have been exposed,
  or if there is legal enforcement of a stricter stay-at-home order).

* Get the right cadence in terms of purchasing food and necessities:
  Keep in mind that grocery stores and convenience stores are limiting
  the amount you can buy at a given time, make sure to make regular
  (though not very frequent) trips to stay stocked up on necessities,
  thinking a few weeks ahead. [These trips might be enough to also
  serve as exercise and fresh air, which kills two birds with one stone.]

* Make home station adjustments: You're now spending a lot more time
  at home, and possibly working from home although you previously
  worked in an office. Make adjustments to your home environment to
  make this more feasible.

* Switch social activities online as much as possible, and plan a
  little bit for them: If you got a lot of your social energy from
  serendipitious in-person interaction, this will be in short
  supply. Instead, you may have to plan the equivalent online things a
  bit more. In many cases, more conscious planning and coordination
  may be needed. But make sure to plan and push for the online
  equivalents where feasible. This is important because it's likely
  the lockdown will last long enough.
