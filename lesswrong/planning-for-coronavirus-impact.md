In this document, I attempt to discuss the impact of the coronavirus
lockdown and how to prepare for it. This is not focused on the direct
impact of coronavirus, but rather on the secondary impact of
precautions that people are taking.

I'll try to update this regularly for the next few weeks, but please
keep in mind that the document may get out of date on specifics.

## A note on lockdown timeline

Based on current trends in coronavirus cases and the impact of
existing lockdowns, I expect that "shelter in place" orders (such as
[San Francisco's](https://sf.gov/stay-home-except-essential-needs)), or
social pressure to do the equivalent, will last till:

* At least April 28: Greater than 75%
* At least May 19: Greater than 45%
* At least June 9: Greater than 30%
* At least June 30: Greater than 20%
* At least September 30: Greater than 10%

I am giving lower bounds on probabilities rather than point estimates
of probabilities, because I don't feel confident enough to give point
estimates, and also because getting precise probability estimates
isn't as important as getting lower bounds that are good enough to
drive specific decisions.

I won't go into details of how I came up with these estimates, but
it's a result of a mix of various factors, including close monitoring
of coronavirus statistics (from the Wikipedia pages), as well as
reading Bill Gates' prediction that [if done right, the lockdown could
last 6 to 10
weeks](https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-coronavirus-shut-downs-done-well-last-6-10-weeks-2020-3).

I expect that many readers on LessWrong will consider these lower
bounds very conservative. They're probably right, but even these
conservative bounds are good enough for my purposes.

Even after the orders are lifted, it is quite likely that it won't be
a good idea to venture out, for personal safety reasons, if you can
avoid it.

## General principles

* Brace for a 2-3 month timeline for the lockdown, with the
  possibility of a 6-month lockdown.

* With that in mind, consciously brace for this, adjust, and plan
  accordingly.

* Keep a buffer, but don't engage in panic actions.

## Impact on social life and day-to-day life experience

Staying at home, and refraining from participating in social
activities, is something that could get harder and harder as the time
period gets longer. Some social activities are easy to forgo for a
week, but harder to forgo for two months. I expect that this could
lead to people feeling depression, loneliness, and mental health
issues, with the risks increasing the longer this continues.

A silver lining is that the reduced level of necessary activity, in
particular commuting, may help people recover from months or even
years of hectic commutes.

The balance of these factors will vary from person to person, but I
expect that for most people, the social life impact will be a net
negative.

What can we do? Here are a few thoughts:

* Brace for impact! It's important to psychologically prepare for the
  idea that you may have to shelter in place for at least another
  month, and possibly two or three or even more months.

* Exploit the positives: You can't do some social activities that you
  normally do, but perhaps the shelter-in-place and the saved commute
  time gives you more flexibility and time to do some other things
  you've always wanted to do but never had the bandwidth for. For
  instance, maybe you can spend evenings working on a long-deferred
  personal project, or learn a new skill, instead of being stuck in
  the commute.

* Strike the right balance in terms of going out: It's reasonably safe
  to go out if you stay far from people and don't touch stuff. So,
  make sure to get a reasonable amount of exercise and fresh
  air. Don't stay cooped up in your home for days. (Obviously,
  exceptions apply for people who are sick or may have been exposed,
  or if there is legal enforcement of a stricter stay-at-home order).

* Get the right cadence in terms of purchasing food and necessities:
  Keep in mind that grocery stores and convenience stores are limiting
  the amount you can buy at a given time, make sure to make regular
  (though not very frequent) trips to stay stocked up on necessities,
  thinking a few weeks ahead. [These trips might be enough to also
  serve as exercise and fresh air, which kills two birds with one stone.]

* Make home station adjustments: You're now spending a lot more time
  at home, and possibly working from home although you previously
  worked in an office. Make adjustments to your home environment to
  make this more feasible.

* Switch social activities online as much as possible, and plan a
  little bit for them: If you got a lot of your social energy from
  serendipitious in-person interaction, this will be in short
  supply. Instead, you may have to plan the equivalent online things a
  bit more. In many cases, more conscious planning and coordination
  may be needed. But make sure to plan and push for the online
  equivalents where feasible. This is important because it's likely
  the lockdown will last long enough.

## Impact on work life and job security

Some of this overlaps with the previous section, but with a different
focus. This mostly applies to jobs where the new norm is to work from
home, rather than ones where you've been furloughed or ones where
physical presence in the office is still required:

* Negotiate a new work-life balance: The previous work-life balance
  you worked out probably needs to be adjusted in light of the new
  situation. For instance, perhaps you can start work earlier and end
  later, but need more breaks within the day because the grocery store
  closes earlier so you need to shop during the day. Think through the
  right balance that works for you and your employer. This may take a
  few days to figure out.

* Make sure lines of communication and recognition of your work have
  adjusted to the work-from-home reality: Even if you're doing just as
  much work as you were doing in the past, your boss or colleagues may
  not realize that. Make sure that the "optics" angle is
  well-covered. The specifics will vary from job to job.

* Keep in mind that getting a new job may be harder, so try to secure
  yourself in your existing job more: At least until the lockdown is
  in place, and possibly even for a few more months, switching jobs
  will be hard. So, try as much as possible to get along with your
  existing job. This is true even if your industry isn't directly
  affected in a severe way; for people in industries that are heavily
  affected, the situation is much trickier. NOTE: If you are in a
  heavily affected industry and have an opportuunity to jump to a less
  affected one, consider taking it. But secure the new opportunity
  first before jumping ship.

## Financial impact

* Give more importance to building a liquid savings buffer. In my
  [simple financial advice
  doc](https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/tree/master/simple-financial-advice.md),
  I recommend building liquid savings up to 30,000 USD under normal
  circumstances, but in this situation, I suggest increasing your
  liquid savings to 60,000 to 90,000 USD, times the number of people
  you are sharing finances with.
  * Use 60,000 USD if you are not in an industry that seems to be
    directly heavily affected, use 90,000 USD if your industry seems
    affected.
  * This will help ride through a longer recession as well as the risk
    of job loss. I am assuming that about 30,000 USD can get you
    through one year with a reasonably frugal lifetstyle but without
    undue sacrifice.
  * In other words, I'm suggesting you keep savings for 2 or 3 years,
    instead of merely 1 year, in light of the coronavirus situation.
* In particular, I suggest:
  * Stop contributing to retirement accounts until you have hit the
    increased liquid savings threshold. With that said, if you do have
    more liquid savings, increasing contributions to retirement
    accounts may be a great idea.
  * Hold off on repaying very-low-interest loans such as student loans
    until you have hit the increased liquid savings threshold (though
    it's best to do calculations for each loan to trade off the
    interest rate against the loss of liquidity).
  * If you are well below your liquid savings threshold, investigate
    how much of your money is in retirement accounts and make
    contingency plans to liquidate some of it to shore up your liquid
    savings. Liquidating retirement accounts may come with a penalty,
    which is why it's better to store any new money you're getting in
    more liquid forms.
* Beyond the goal of maintaining liquidity to weather you through 2 to
  3 years, don't engage in panic buying or selling of assets. In
  relative terms, the stock market may be a good buy right now and
  putting money there could be a good idea if you expect that you
  won't need to take money out for the next 2 to 3 years.
* On a similar note, if you engage in regular philanthropy or in
  consumer spending that gives you happiness, continue with it as long
  as (a) it still makes sense in the context of the lockdown, and (b)
  your liquidity goals are met. In other words, after securing your
  health and wealth, continue your life as close to normal as
  possible.
