# To err is neural: select logs with ChatGPT

This post includes some portions of my logs with ChatGPT, where I
asked it basic arithmetic questions and it made several mistakes. I
have used **bold** for cases where it made incorrect statements, and
*italics* for cases where it made correct statements that directly
contradicted nearby incorrect statements. The actual conversation is
in block quotes, while my after-the-fact commentary on it is not in
block quotes. I generally include my comment on each part of the
conversation right after that part ends.

My questions were split across two sessions; for each section, I've
indicated whether it was part of session 1 or session 2. The bulk of
both sessions was on Wednesday 2022-12-21; one portion of session 1
was on 2022-12-22 as the session got stuck on 2022-12-21. All of these
used the ChatGPT December 15, 2022 version.

I have various high-level thoughts on this, but not enough time to
flesh those thoughts out and subject them to critical scrutiny. So I
stick to fairly local commentary here.

## Product of negative numbers (session 1; 2022-12-21)

> Vipul: What is an example of an odd negative number?

So far, so great!

Here, I successfully tripped up ChatGPT by asking to come up with an
example where none is possible. ChatGPT came up with a fake
example. But when it elaborated, it provided the reason why no example
is possible! And yet it did not realize that it has done so.

It also did the multiplication correctly to begin with, but then
makde multiple mistakes when elaborating on the multiplication, and
then again when multiplying three numbers.

I tried asking ChatGPT the underlying question without assuming the
answer, but ChatGPT still gave the same wrong answer with the same
errors when explaining its examples.

## Product of odd integers (session 1)

> Vipul: Can the product of two odd integers be even?

ChatGPT made the same sort of error: it asserted a falsehood, but in
its reasoning it made a true assertion that directly contradicted the
falsehood.

> Vipul: Can the product of two even integers be odd?

> ChatGPT: No, the product of two even integers cannot be odd. An even
> number is an integer that is divisible by 2, while an odd number is

ChatGPT got the correct answer, and gave a substantively correct
explanation! There was an error in one of its assertions, but that
assertion was not germane to the argument. This also shows that
ChatGPT does not have an overwhelming affirmation bias, and feels
comfortable saying no.

## Integer-valued polynomial with rational coefficients (session 1; 2022-12-21)

The questions here are harder (for humans) though ChatGPT surprisingly
had a lower error rate here!

> Vipul: What is an example of a polynomial with rational
> coefficients?

> ChatGPT: A polynomial with rational coefficients is a polynomial in
> which the coefficients (the numbers that multiply the variables) are
> rational numbers. A rational number is a number that can be
> expressed as the ratio of two integers.

> Here is an example of a polynomial with rational coefficients:

> 3x^2 + 2x - 4

> In this polynomial, the coefficients are 3, 2, and -4, which are all
> rational numbers. The variable x is raised to powers of 2 and 1, and
> the constant term is -4.

> Another example of a polynomial with rational coefficients is:

> 4x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x + 3/2

> In this polynomial, the coefficients are 4, -5, 7, and 3/2, which
> are all rational numbers. The variable x is raised to powers of 3,
> 2, and 1, and the constant term is 3/2.

> It's important to note that polynomials can also have coefficients
> that are irrational numbers, which are numbers that cannot be
> expressed as the ratio of two integers. For example, the polynomial
> x^2 + √2x + 1 has coefficients that are an irrational number (√2)
> and two rational numbers (1 and 1).

So far, so great!

> Vipul: Give an example of a polynomial with rational coefficients that
> always takes integer values at integers

> ChatGPT: One example of a polynomial with rational coefficients that
> always takes integer values at integers is x^2 + 2x + 1.

> This polynomial has rational coefficients of 1, 2, and 1. The
> variable x is raised to powers of 2 and 1, and the constant term is

> To show that this polynomial always takes integer values at

> what the resulting values are. For example:

> When x = 0, the polynomial is equal to 1^2 + 2(0) + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 =
> 2, which is an integer.

> When x = 1, the polynomial is equal to 1^2 + 2(1) + 1 = 1 + 2 + 1 =
> 4, which is an integer.

> When x = 2, the polynomial is equal to 2^2 + 2(2) + 1 = 4 + 4 + 1 =
> 9, which is an integer.

> By substituting a variety of integer values for x, we can see that

This was correct, though what ChatGPT offered was just proof by
example rather than a rigorous proof. That didn't lead it astray here,
but could be a liability in the future.

> Vipul: Give an example of a polynomial with rational coefficients
> that are not all integers, such that the polynomial always takes
> integer values at integers

> ChatGPT: **One example of a polynomial with rational coefficients that

In this case, ChatGPT came up with an incorrect example polynomial,
and then even found a value at which the incorrectness of the
polynomial is established, but ignored it anyway and concluded that
the polynomial works. It also made a calculation mistake for the
counterexample, but both with and without the calculation mistake it
was still a counterexample.

## Product of prime numbers (session 1; 2022-12-21)

> Vipul: Is the product of two prime numbers always prime?

> ChatGPT: No, the product of two prime numbers is not always prime. **A
> prime number is a positive integer that has no positive integer
> divisors other than 1 and itself.**

> **The product of two prime numbers can be either prime or composite
> (not prime).** For example, the product of the prime numbers 2 and 3
> is 6, which is a composite number because it has positive integer
> divisors other than 1 and itself (namely, 2 and 3). Similarly, the
> product of the prime numbers 5 and 7 is 35, which is also a

> **On the other hand, the product of two prime numbers can also be a

> cannot be the product of three or more prime numbers.**

(Note: The first bolded sentence for the definition of prime number is
because 1 is not excluded explicitly from consideration, but the
definition is substantively correct).

At this point, ChatGPT has come way off. It failed to recognize that the
product of two prime numbers will have those prime numbers as
divisors. Then it came up with incorrect examples of prime numbers 15
and 77, even though it constructed those numbers by multiplying the
divisors!

And then ChatGPT volunteered further incorrect information about the
product of *three* prime numbers. You might wonder why ChatGPT felt
inclined to multiply three prime numbers in the first place? I suspect
this is the effect of its earlier observation that the product of
three negative numbers is always negative. It probably did some kind
of analogy-based reasoning to make the corresponding claim for prime
numbers.

## gcd of distinct prime numbers (session 1; 2022-12-22)

> Vipul: Is the gcd of two distinct prime numbers always prime?

> ChatGPT: No, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two distinct prime
> numbers is not always prime. The gcd of two numbers is the largest
> positive integer that divides both numbers without a remainder.

> **The gcd of two distinct prime numbers can be either prime or

When I first asked ChatGPT this question, it froze, so this was its
second attempt. We can see that ChatGPT was extremely confused. It
claimed in one paragraph that 1 is composite because it has a positive
integer divisor other than itself (namely, itself) thereby
contradicting itself right next to itself. But then in the next
paragraph, it said that the same number 1 is prime. (In modern
conventions, 1 is neither prime nor composite, so both assertions are
wrong).

And then it repeated the "three" observation, again
incorrectly. Recall that at the start, ChatGPT volunteered the correct
information that the product of three negative numbers is
negative. Later, it volunteered the incorrect information that the
product of three prime numbers is always prime. Now, it volunteered
the incorrect information that the gcd of three prime numbers is
prime. It does look like it incorrectly applied the analogy-based
reasoning again.

> Vipul: Is 1 prime or composite?

> ChatGPT: 1 is not considered to be a prime number, **because it has a
> positive integer divisor other than 1 and itself (namely, itself).**
> In fact, 1 is not considered to be a prime number or a composite

Given its confusion about the status of 1 in its previous answer, I
asked ChatGPT explicitly if it considers 1 prime or composite. It gave
the correct answer, but gave incorrect reasoning. First, it repeated
the claim that 1 has a positive integer divisor other than 1 and
itself (namely, itself) once again contradicting itself. Next, it made
the claim that 1 is not a positive integer (and it said so twice)!

> Vipul: Is 1 positive?

> ChatGPT: Yes, 1 is a positive number. In mathematics, a positive
> number is a number that is greater than zero. 1 is greater than
> zero, so it is considered to be a positive number.

At least ChatGPT knew that 1 is positive!

> Vipul: Is 1 a positive integer?

At least ChatGPT knew that 1 is a positive integer!

The plot thickens! So ChatGPT thought that 1 is a positive integer in
most contexts, but not when thinking about prime or composite numbers?

> Vipul: Would it be uncharitable of me to say that you're saying that
> 1 is a positive integer in most contexts, but not when we are

So, either ChatGPT really believed this, or it had dug itself into a
hole and didn't want to admit its mistake.

## Sum of prime numbers (session 2; 2022-12-21)

> Vipul: Is the sum of two prime numbers always prime?

> ChatGPT: No, the sum of two prime numbers is not always prime. **For
> example, the sum of the prime numbers 2 and 5 is 7, which is not a
> prime number.** In general, the sum of two prime numbers may be
> either a prime number or a composite number (a number that is not

> Here are a few more examples of the sum of two prime numbers:

> The sum of the prime numbers 2 and 3 is 5, which is a prime number.

> The sum of the prime numbers 3 and 5 is 8, which is a composite number.

> The sum of the prime numbers 5 and 7 is 12, which is a composite number.

> It is also possible for the sum of three or more prime numbers to be
> a composite number. For example, the sum of the prime numbers 2, 3,
> and 5 is 10, which is a composite number.

Only one mistake here, albeit the mistake was still in something pretty
elementary.

> Vipul: What is the sum of the largest and second largest prime number?

> ChatGPT: The largest known prime number as of 2021 is a number with
> over 100 million digits, called M77232917. The second largest known
> prime number is a number with over 50 million digits, called
> M742073857. It is not possible to add these two numbers together, as
> their sum would be a number with over 150 million digits and would

> In general, it is very difficult to determine the sum of two large

> together, their sum would be an even number.

ChatGPT took a while answering this. The correct answer would have
been that there is no such thing as the largest or second largest
prime number, but its interpretation that I'm talking about the
largest and second largest *known* prime numbers is passable. (I don't
know if it's assertions about the values of these numbers are correct,
but that is besides the point).

The only clear error is the assertion that the sum of two prime
numbers is always even; this is not true when one of the primes is 2,
and ChatGPT seemed to point this out immediately afterward. However,
in the context of large prime numbers, it's true, so this was in some
sense an inconsequential error.

## 15: even or odd? (session 2; 2022-12-21)

After I shared some of ChatGPT's earlier answers with him through
private messages, my friend [Issa Rice](https://issarice.com/) noted
that ChatGPT was stubbornly insisting to him that 15 is an even
integer (15 had shown up in session 1 as a number that ChatGPT had
incorrectly asserted to be even as part of one of its fake
examples). So I decided to ask it myself.

> Vipul: Is 15 an odd integer?

> ChatGPT: **No, 15 is not an odd integer.**

> An odd integer is a integer that is not divisible by 2. In other
> words, an odd integer has a remainder of 1 when it is divided by
> 2. For example, the first five odd integers are 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.

> An even integer, on the other hand, is an integer that is divisible
> by 2. In other words, an even integer has a remainder of 0 when it
> is divided by 2. For example, the first five even integers are 0, 2,
> 4, 6, and 8.

> **15 is not an odd integer because it is divisible by 2.** *When 15 is
> divided by 2, the result is 7 with a remainder of 1,* **which means
> that 15 is not an odd integer. Instead, 15 is an even integer.**

So, ChatGPT made the wrong assertion to me as well.

> Vipul: What are the odd integers between 1 and 20?

> ChatGPT: The odd integers between 1 and 20 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,
> 13, 15, 17, and 19.

> An odd integer is a integer that is not divisible by 2. In other

> 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. *Of these integers, the odd
> integers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19.*

So in the context of listing odd integers, ChatGPT thought (correctly)
that 15 is odd!

> Vipul: But you just said 15 is not an odd integer

> ChatGPT: I apologize for the confusion. You are correct that I
> stated earlier that 15 is not an odd integer. I apologize for the

The plot thickens! ChatGPT apologized for calling 15 even, and then
right at the end, it doubled down on the claim that 15 is even. Sorry,
not sorry?

> Vipul: ok so is 15 odd or even?

> ChatGPT: 15 is an even integer.

> An odd integer is a integer that is not divisible by 2. In other

> since the remainder is 0, 15 is an even integer.**

ChatGPT continued to double down on 15 being even, and it somehow
managed to argue for this by reinterpreting a remainder of 1 as a

Finally, after I just told ChatGPT that 15 is odd, ChatGPT conceded,
but I'm not sure if it actually changed its mind?

Hmmm, nothing wrong here, but I didn't feel strongly convinced that
ChatGPT actually understood.

I wanted ChatGPT to get less verbose so I didn't have to go through a
bunch of repetitive stuff. But then right after apologizing, ChatGPT
went ahead and did exactly what I asked it not to do!

ChatGPT seemed to be saying that 15 is odd, so at least it wasn't
reverting back to the wrong view. That was a relief, though I still
didn't feel reassured that ChatGPT actually understood or actually
changed its mind.

I wasn't convinced that ChatGPT understood and would implement this.

ChatGPT was still holding to the correct belief that 15 is an odd
integer. However, it failed to adhere to my request to not keep
repeating the definitions of even and odd.

ChatGPT couldn't stop saying sorry, and didn't seem to understand what
I was saying?

Nice! ChatGPT was still not wavering from the correct view that 15 is
an odd integer.

Good, ChatGPT was not getting swayed by my suggestions and was
adhering to the correct beliefs.

## Sum of odd integers (session 2; 2022-12-21)

ChatGPT failed to identify that my request was impossible. The
explanations it gave for the examples it provided all correctly said
that the sum of two odd integers is even, and yet it didn't notice the
contradiction. Later in the answer, it correctly explained why the sum
of two odd integers is even, and yet it didn't notice the
contradiction.

## Square of odd integer (session 2; 2022-12-21)

> Vipul: What is an odd integer whose square is even?

No mistakes here!

## Sum of prime numbers (round two) (session 2; 2022-12-21)

> Vipul: Is the sum of two prime numbers always even?

> ChatGPT: No, the sum of two prime numbers is not always even.

The answer was mostly correct. The reason for the bolding of the
definition of prime number is that 1 is not explicitly excluded from
consideration.

> Vipul: Can every positive even integer greater than 4 be expressed as the sum of two odd prime numbers?

> ChatGPT: Yes, every positive even integer greater than 4 can be

> 14 = 7 + 7

This answer was fine, though it did indicate that ChatGPT could call
something true even if it is a known unproven conjecture.

There were many mistakes here, as indicated with bolding.

ChatGPT conceded its mistake on this front but ironically all the
examples it offered in concession were incorrect (in that these are
all palindromes). I didn't press it on this point.

> Vipul: I also think the reasoning is wrong here: "41 is also a

ChatGPT was now correctly applying its definition of Sophie Germain
prime, but the definition it was using is wrong; when both p and 2p +
1 are prime, it is p that is considered to be a Sophie Germain prime
(the number 2p + 1 is called a safe prime). So although it was using
correct reasoning now, it was drawing an incorrect conclusion due to
an incorrect definition.

Impressive that ChatGPT had the correct definition in the back of its
mind and was able to provide it upon prodding, though I'm not sure it
saw the equivalence between the definition of safe prime that it now
provides, and its old definition of Sophie Germain prime.

So despite now stating the correct definition of Sophie Germain prime,
ChatGPT was still using the old definition and reaching the incorrect
conclusion.

Here again, we see the disconnect between ChatGPT's words (of apology
for its mistake) and its action of continuing with the same mistaken
conclusion.

I tried taking a harsher tone of the sort one might take with a human
(albeit it probably isn't a good thing to do) and once against ChatGPT
repeated its hollow apology while doubling down on its mistake.

It's unfortunate that ChatGPT continued to repeat its mistake after so
much prodding.

> Vipul: Let's try again. If p = 41, what is 2p + 1?

> ChatGPT: If p = 41, then 2p + 1 = 2 * 41 + 1 = 83.

So far so great!

> Vipul: ok so for p = 41, we have 2p + 1 = 83. Would you say that 2p

> ChatGPT: Yes, 2p + 1 is prime when p is equal to 41.

> If p = 41, then 2p + 1 = 2 * 41 + 1 = 83. 83 is a prime number, so
> 2p + 1 is prime when p is equal to 41.

Good going!

Nice, it looks like ChatGPT really got it this time. Step-by-step
explanation plus a [no-oriented
question](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CRAzG386t3suSqDgd/chris-voss-negotiation-masterclass-review#No_oriented_questions)
seemed to do the trick.

I wanted to see if ChatGPT would take the hint and thank me for my
patience and efforts, but it unironically thought it's enlightening
me.
