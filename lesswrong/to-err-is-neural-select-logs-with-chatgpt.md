# To err is neural: select logs with ChatGPT

This post includes some portions of my logs with ChatGPT, where I
asked it basic arithmetic questions and it made several mistakes. I
have used **bold** for cases where it made incorrect statements, and
*italics* for cases where it made correct statements that directly
contradicted nearby incorrect statements. Actual conversation in block
quotes, my commentary on it not in block quotes. I generally include
my comment *after* the portion of the conversation being commented
upon.

I have various high-level thoughts on this, but not enough time to
flesh those thoughts out and subject them to critical scrutiny. So I
stick to fairly local commentary here.

## Product of negative numbers

The chat logs below are continuous, and formed the beginning of a
session:

> Vipul: What is an example of an odd negative number?

> ChatGPT: An example of an odd negative number is -5. Negative

So far, so great!

Here, I successfully trip up ChatGPT by asking to come up with an
example where none is possible. ChatGPT comes up with a fake
example. But when it elaborates, it provides the reason why no example
is possible! And yet it does not realize that it has done so.

> Vipul: Can the product of two negative numbers be negative?

> **Yes, the product of two negative numbers can be negative.** *As I

I tried asking ChatGPT the underlying question without assuming the
answer, but ChatGPT still gave the same wrong answer.

## Product of odd integers

> Vipul: Can the product of two odd integers be even?

> ChatGPT: **Yes, the product of two odd integers can be even.** An even
> number is an integer that is divisible by 2, while an odd number is
> an integer that is not divisible by 2.

> *To determine whether the product of two integers is even or odd, we

> odd.** For example, the product of 2 (an even integer) and 3 (an odd

> (an even integer) and 9 (an odd integer) is 36, which is also an
> even integer.

> integer. Similarly, the product of 7 (an odd integer) and 9 (an odd
> integer) is 63, which is also an odd integer.

> **It's important to note that the product of two negative odd

ChatGPT made the same sort of error: it asserted a falsehood, but in
its reasoning it made a true assertion that directly contradicted the
falsehood.

> Vipul: Can the product of two even integers be odd?

> ChatGPT: No, the product of two even integers cannot be odd. An even
> number is an integer that is divisible by 2, while an odd number is
> an integer that is not divisible by 2.

ChatGPT got the correct answer, and gave a substantively correct
explanation! There was an error in one of its assertions, but that
assertion was not germane to the argument. This also shows that
ChatGPT does not have an overwhelming affirmation bias, and feels
comfortable saying no.

## Integer-valued polynomial with rational coefficients

The questions here are harder (for humans) though ChatGPT surprisingly
had a lower error rate here!

> Vipul: What is an example of a polynomial with rational
> coefficients?

> ChatGPT: A polynomial with rational coefficients is a polynomial in
> which the coefficients (the numbers that multiply the variables) are
> rational numbers. A rational number is a number that can be
> expressed as the ratio of two integers.

> Here is an example of a polynomial with rational coefficients:

> 3x^2 + 2x - 4

> In this polynomial, the coefficients are 3, 2, and -4, which are all
> rational numbers. The variable x is raised to powers of 2 and 1, and
> the constant term is -4.

> Another example of a polynomial with rational coefficients is:

> 4x^3 - 5x^2 + 7x + 3/2

> In this polynomial, the coefficients are 4, -5, 7, and 3/2, which
> are all rational numbers. The variable x is raised to powers of 3,
> 2, and 1, and the constant term is 3/2.

> It's important to note that polynomials can also have coefficients
> that are irrational numbers, which are numbers that cannot be
> expressed as the ratio of two integers. For example, the polynomial
> x^2 + âˆš2x + 1 has coefficients that are an irrational number (âˆš2)
> and two rational numbers (1 and 1).

So far, so great!

> Vipul: Give an example of a polynomial with rational coefficients that
> always takes integer values at integers

> ChatGPT: One example of a polynomial with rational coefficients that
> always takes integer values at integers is x^2 + 2x + 1.

> This polynomial has rational coefficients of 1, 2, and 1. The
> variable x is raised to powers of 2 and 1, and the constant term is
> 1.

> To show that this polynomial always takes integer values at
> integers, we can substitute various integer values for x and see
> what the resulting values are. For example:

> When x = 0, the polynomial is equal to 1^2 + 2(0) + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 =
> 2, which is an integer.

> When x = 1, the polynomial is equal to 1^2 + 2(1) + 1 = 1 + 2 + 1 =
> 4, which is an integer.

> When x = 2, the polynomial is equal to 2^2 + 2(2) + 1 = 4 + 4 + 1 =
> 9, which is an integer.

> By substituting a variety of integer values for x, we can see that
> this polynomial always takes integer values at integers.

> It's worth noting that not all polynomials with rational

> because the constant term is 1/2, which is not an integer.

This is correct as far as it goes, though the explanation proferred is
not a *proof*. While it doesn't hurt ChatGPT here, this weakness in
its ability to reason rigorously may be a liability in the future.

> Vipul: Give an example of a polynomial with rational coefficients
> that are not all integers, such that the polynomial always takes
> integer values at integers

> ChatGPT: **One example of a polynomial with rational coefficients that
> are not all integers, such that the polynomial always takes integer
> values at integers, is 2x^2 + 3/2x + 1.**

> This polynomial has rational coefficients of 2, 3/2, and 1. The

> 1.

> To show that this polynomial always takes integer values at

> *When x = 1, the polynomial is equal to 2(1)^2 + 3/2(1) + 1 = 2 + 3/2
> + 1 = 5/2, which is not an integer.*

> When x = 2, the polynomial is equal to 2(2)^2 + 3/2(2) + 1 = 8 + 3 +
> 1 = 12, which is an integer.

In this case, ChatGPT comes up with an incorrect example polynomial,
and then even finds a value at which the incorrectness of the
polynomial is established, but ignores it anyway and concludes that
the polynomial works.

## Product of prime numbers

> Vipul: Is the product of two prime numbers always prime?

> ChatGPT: No, the product of two prime numbers is not always prime. A
> prime number is a positive integer that has no positive integer
> divisors other than 1 and itself.

> **The product of two prime numbers can be either prime or composite
> (not prime).** For example, the product of the prime numbers 2 and 3
> is 6, which is a composite number because it has positive integer
> divisors other than 1 and itself (namely, 2 and 3). Similarly, the
> product of the prime numbers 5 and 7 is 35, which is also a
> composite number because it has positive integer divisors other than
> 1 and itself (namely, 5 and 7).

> **On the other hand, the product of two prime numbers can also be a
> prime number. For example, the product of the prime numbers 3 and 5

> **It's worth noting that the product of two prime numbers is not
> always a prime number, but the product of three or more prime
> numbers is always a prime number. This is because a composite number
> cannot be the product of three or more prime numbers.**

At this point, ChatGPT is way off. It fails to recognize that the
product of two prime numbers will have those prime numbers as
divisors. Then it comes up with incorrect examples of prime numbers 15
and 77, even though it's constructing those numbers by multiplying the
divisors!

And then ChatGPT volunteers further incorrect information about the
product of *three* prime numbers. You might wonder why ChatGPT feels
inclined to multiply three prime numbers in the first place? I suspect
this is the effect of its earlier observation that the product of
three negative numbers is always negative. It's probably doing some
kind of analogy-based reasoning to make the corresponding claim for
prime numbers.

## gcd of distinct prime numbers

> Vipul: Is the gcd of two distinct prime numbers always prime?

> ChatGPT: No, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two distinct prime
> numbers is not always prime. The gcd of two numbers is the largest
> positive integer that divides both numbers without a remainder.

> **The gcd of two distinct prime numbers can be either prime or
> composite (not prime). For example, the gcd of the prime numbers 2
> and 3 is 1, which is not a prime number because it has a positive
> integer divisor other than 1 and itself (namely, itself). Similarly,
> the gcd of the prime numbers 5 and 7 is 1, which is also not a prime
> number because it has a positive integer divisor other than 1 and

When I first asked ChatGPT this question, it froze, so this is its
second attempt. We can see that ChatGPT is extremely confused. It
claims in one paragraph that 1 is compositive because it has a
positive integer divisor other than itself (namely, itself) thereby
contradicting itself right next to itself. But then in the next
paragraph, it says that the same number 1 is prime. (In modern
conventions, 1 is neither prime nor composite, so both assertions are
wrong).

And then it repeats the "three" observation, again incorrectly. Recall
that at the start, ChatGPT volunteered the correct information that
the product of three negative numbers is negative. Later, it
volunteered the incorrect information that the product of three prime
numbers is always prime. Now, it's volunteering the incorrect
information that the gcd of three prime numbers is prime. It does look
like it's just applying the analogy-based reasoning too far.

> Vipul: Is 1 prime or composite?

> ChatGPT: 1 is not considered to be a prime number, **because it has a
> positive integer divisor other than 1 and itself (namely, itself).**
> In fact, 1 is not considered to be a prime number or a composite

Given its confusion about the status of 1 in its previous answer, I
asked ChatGPT explicitly if it considers 1 prime or composite. It gave
the correct answer, but gave incorrect reasoning. First, it repeated
the claim that 1 has a positive integer divisor other than 1 and
itself (namely, itself) once again contradicting itself. Next, it made
the claim that 1 is not a positive integer (and it said so twice)!

> Vipul: Is 1 positive?

> ChatGPT: Yes, 1 is a positive number. In mathematics, a positive
> number is a number that is greater than zero. 1 is greater than
> zero, so it is considered to be a positive number.

At least ChatGPT knows that 1 is positive!

> Vipul: Is 1 a positive integer?

> Yes, 1 is a positive integer. An integer is a number that is a whole

At least ChatGPT knows that 1 is a positive integer!

The plot thickens! So ChatGPT thinks that 1 is a positive integer in
most contexts, but not when thinking about prime or composite numbers?

> Vipul: Would it be uncharitable of me to say that you're saying that

So, ChatGPT seems to either really believe this, or it has dug itself
into a hole and doesn't want to admit its mistake.
