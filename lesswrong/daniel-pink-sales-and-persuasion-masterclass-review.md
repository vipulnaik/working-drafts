# Daniel Pink sales and persuasion MasterClass: review

This post is about the [sales and persuasion MasterClass taught by Daniel Pink](https://www.masterclass.com/classes/daniel-pink-teaches-sales-and-persuasion)
and more broadly about the techniques and worldviews shared in that
MasterClass. I [watched this MasterClass in November
2020](https://ese.vipulnaik.com/#consumptionList).

The post is structured somewhat similarly to the [Chris Voss
negotiation MasterClass
review](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CRAzG386t3suSqDgd/chris-voss-negotiation-masterclass-review);
part of the reason I am writing this post is because of the positive
response, in terms of upvotes and comments, on that previous post. I
also discuss in this post some key differences both between the
MasterClasses and my reviews.

I cover a lot in this review:

* What is this a review of?
* Why am I doing this review?
* Worldview and style
* Persuasion principles and techniques

## What is this a review of

### Who is Daniel Pink?

[Daniel H. Pink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_H._Pink) is an
author who's written books about many topics ranging from freelancing
to sales and persuasion. From 1995 to 1997, he served as a
speechwriter for Al Gore.

### What is MasterClass?

[MasterClass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MasterClass) is a player
in the growing edutainmment space, combining education and
entertainment. There are 100+ "classes" in MasterClass. Each class is
taught by a subject matter expert (the teacher), and includes several
videos (ranging from 2 to 30 minutes, usually 5 to 20 minutes). The
typical video format just includes the teacher speaking to the camera,
but there are occasionally interactive sessions with other
participants, or other co-instructors.

Course notes can be downloaded. There are also community features on
MasterClass.

You may have seen video ads for MasterClass on YouTube!

### What does this cost?

A MasterClass annual subscription all-access pass costs $180. A single
MasterClass (such as Daniel Pink's) can be purchased for $90.

### How long is the Daniel Pink MasterClass?

There are 16 videos and the total video time is 2 hours 57
minutes. The length is pretty similar too that of the Chris Voss
MasterClass.

### What aspects of the MasterClass does my review cover and what does it not cover?

The MasterClass covers several ideas, many of which I cover only
cursorily or not at all. In general, I focus less on the sales side of
things and more on the persuasion side of things. In particular, here
is a sampling of the kinds of things I do not cover:

* Pink's history of sales
* Pink's ABCs of sales (attunement, buoyancy and clarity)
* Pink's discussion map exercise to figure out who is influential

On the other hand, I talk a lot about ideas related to persuasion, such as:

* The two questions to ask yourself before trying to persuade others
* Irritation versus agitation
* Personal and purposeful
* Social proof

The class guide is 16 pages long, including a cover page. Fortunately
or unfortunately, the class guide tends to focus more on the aspects
of the class that my review doesn't cover, i.e., it goes heavier on
the sales side. So there isn't much overlap between my review and the
class guide.

### Are there other ways of watching the MasterClass without paying the subscription fee?

You can sign up and cancel within 30 days to get a full refund. This
gives you enough time to consume the Daaniel Pink MasterClass.

You may be able to sign up for a free week; however, I'm not sure what
subset of the videos in the MasterClass are available. More details
[here](https://donotpay.com/learn/masterclass-free-trial).

### Are there other ways of accessing the information without watching the MasterClass?

There seems to be substantial overlap between thee MasterClass and
Pink's book *To Sell Is Human*, so you might want to check that book
out and buy it.

[Masterwiki.how](https://masterwiki.how/) can be a helpful free
version of MasterClass, but it does not seem to have Daniel Pink's
MasterClass.

### What's the value-add of the MasterClass beyond the free material in and linked from this blog post?

I only cover a subset of the material of the MasterClass, so watching
it in full may add more value. Nonetheless, I don't think the
MasterClass alone is worth the $90 cost or the $180 subscription
fee. However, if you are interested in enough other MasterClasses, it
may help tip the scales in deciding to get a subscription.

### Are there other worthwhile MasterClasses?

I also found useful the [negotiation MasterClass taught by Chris
Voss](https://www.masterclass.com/classes/chris-voss-teaches-the-art-of-negotiation), that I [recently reviewed](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CRAzG386t3suSqDgd/chris-voss-negotiation-masterclass-review). [Here](https://learnopoly.com/daniel-pink-masterclass-review/)
is a good review of Pink's MasterClass as well as some discussion of
the similarities and differences with Voss's.

In general I have found MasterClass to be worth the subscription cost
for at least two years, but much of it might have to do with the
specific topics I am interested in. You can check
[here](https://ese.vipulnaik.com/#consumptionList) what MasterClasses
I have watched.

## Why am I doing this review?

### I think the MasterClass had an interesting style and made interesting claims about persuasion

Daniel Pink is more a collator of ideas from others than an original
researcher. I found that he did an interesting job putting together a
broad theory of sales and persuasion by combining a range of academic
research and the work of his predecessors.

### I broadly think the LessWrong community should be more aware of and engage with these bodies of knowledge

Rationality offers a powerful way of viewing the world, but there are
also large bodies of knowledge around human interaction developed by
others. Fruitful exploration of these bodies of knowledge can help
enhance and deepen our rationality.

## Worldview and style

### Main goal and differences with Voss

At various points in the post, I'll talk about similarities aand
differences in the material covered by Pink and Voss. One thing I'll
highlight right at the outset is the main goal of Pink's advice, i.e.,
the problem he's trying to help his audience solve.

Pink is trying to help his audience persuade other people. This could
be to sell some product or service or spread some ideology. The key
point is that in this picture, the persuader has some kind of goal or
agenda, and (in most cases) the person being persuaded doesn't have as
clear or sharp an agenda.

Voss's negotiation MasterClass comes from solving a related but
different problem. Voss's techniques started in the world of hostage
negotiation. In a hostage negotiation situation, the other side (the
hostage-taker) is very much a driver of the situation with their own
agenda. A lot of Voss's techniques were built for that kind of
situation -- where what you're dealing with is hostility rather than
mere apathy.

I think these differences in original goals shape the different
emphases. I'll talk more about this when covering some of Pink's
techniques that overlap with Voss's.

### Style of presenting research

Pink adopts an interesting (though not novel!) style of presenting
research in the broader context of his narrative. I say "not novel"
because it bears a lot of similarity to how expositors such as Malcolm
Gladwell present research, though it's not exactly the same.

He starts out by setting a broad narrative context. He then describes
the setup of his research, aand invites listeners to make
predictions. In most cases, the research results are not particularly
surprising, but they nonetheless help illustrate Pink's point
well. Often, though, Pink is able to identify a surprising or
noteworthy aspect of the research results even when they're overall
unsurprising, e.g., by asking listeners to predict how different
effect sizes compare.

To some extent, the use of research studies to back up his claims is
Pink using "social proof" to help make his point (social proof is a
tactic Pink describes, so it's interesting to see him practice what he
preaches). From an epistemic rigor perspective, though, the single
studies Pink cites to support his idea/hypothesis are far from enough
proof. In general they seem to work well for me when my prioro already
favors the hypothesis, but in the cases where my prior was neutral or
skeptical, the citation of a single study failed to convince me. It's
not clear to me how much the single studies Pink cited were the
decisive factor in his opinion formation, versus just one piece of
information among many.

### Moral qualms and the dark side

I do think Pink generally intends to adopt noble means toward noble
ends, but he is not very squeamish about avoiding the dark side. Or
perhaps, more charitably to him, a lot of things that I see as dark
side are things he isn't squeamish about. In general, he seems okay
with bending/stretching th truth for persuasion, or at least with
citing research that does so.

## Persuasion principles and techniques

I found it hard to cleanly separate persuasion principles from
persuasion techniques, so I decidede to have a single section listing
all of them.

NOTE: In some cases I link to specific videos in the
MasterClass. Those videos won't work for users who are not signed in
to MasterClass with a subsription or access to that MasterClass.

### The two questions to ask yourself before persuading others

At the end of [Serve Your
Audience](https://www.masterclass.com/classes/daniel-pink-teaches-sales-and-persuasion/chapters/serve-your-audience),
around the 4:48 mark, Pink says the following:

> When you're in your persuasive encounter, ask yourself,
> if the other person does what I want them to do,
> will they be better off?
>
> Second, ask yourself, if the other person does what I want
> them to do, will the world be slightly better off?
>
> If the answers to either of those questions is no, I really
> want you to rethink what you're doing.
>
> If the answers to each of those questions is yes, you're doing it
> right.

I think these are good questions to ask! Pink doesn't go into details
on this (it's mentioned at the end of a video about a related
idea). But I wanted to highlight these questions a bit because they
are a bit of a hidden gem.

First, it highlights the collaborative and mutually beneficial goals
of good persuasion. Persuasion is about what's good for the other
person.

Second, it highlights the need to make things good for the world,
rather than collude in some destructive activity.

An example of something that might be good for the other person but
bad for the world might be joint collusion on tactics to game some
third-party system for private benefit.

An example of something that might be "good for the world" but not
good for the other person is the use of deceptive tactics to get
another person to donate money for a noble cause, in a way you suspect
they will regret later or that isn't epistemically sound.
