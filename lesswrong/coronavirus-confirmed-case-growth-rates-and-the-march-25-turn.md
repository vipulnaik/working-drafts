I was looking at the charts for growth in the number of coronavirus
cases across various US states
[Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Washington_(state)),
[California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_California),
[Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Illinois),
[New
York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_New_York_(state)),
and [New
Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_New_Jersey). I
noticed a shared pattern across all four states:

* Until around March 18 (give or take a day or two) case growth in all
  states followed somewhere between a linear and exponential
  pattern. The growth is closest to linear in Washington state; in the
  other states, where the number of confirmed cases was lower, the
  growth is somewhere between linear and exponential.
  
* Confirmed cases increased a lot around March 18, and then continued
  to grow linearly till March 25. The transition was sharp for
  California, Washington, and New York, and a little smoother for
  Illinois. The only state where the growth was clearly superlinear in
  the week from March 18 to March 25 was New Jersey, where the
  confirmed case growth picked up on March 20 and again on March 22.

* In all five states, the rate of case growth changed abruptly
  starting March 25 (i.e., the increase from March 25 to March 26 was
  much higher than the increase from March 24 to March 25) and has
  sustained a linear pattern since then.

I might be seeing some patterns that don't exist. In particular, the
March 18 increase doesn't line up well enough across states for me to
be sure there is a pattern. However, the March 25 pattern seems quite
striking.

This piecewise nature of the graph of number of confirmed cases is
intriguing enough to me. Indeed, ...
