# Retirable abstractions

In this post, I introduce the term "retirable abstaction" and use it
as a lens to look at various abstractions/theories, where the debate
is whether they continue to be useful.

I define a *retirable abstraction* as an abstraction that is no longer
needed, because we have sufficiently better abstractions available
that the original abstraction does not provide any net value-added.

Retirability obviously has some relationship to truth, but there's no
strong implication in either direction: there can be true abstractions
that are retirable because there are better, more powerful, and
easier-to-work-with abstractions that strictly supersede them.

There can also be false abstractions that are still useful because
they're approximately true, and the truer abstraction is much more
complex for only a marginal gain in accuracy.

Let's look at a few case studies.

## Mechanics

### Newtonian (classical) mechanics: not retirable IMHO

For me, [Newtonian (classical)
mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics) is the
model I aspire to apply for most of my day-to-day physical activity,
whether it's me walking inside my home, carrying stuff, or crossing
the road.

Newtonian mechanics is not strictly true; Einsteinian relativity and
quantum mechanics address important issues with Newtonian
mechanics. Despite being untrue, Newtonian mechanics is close enough
to true for a wide range of use cases, and at least for somebody at my
cognitive capacity, I can't compute Einsteinian relativity quickly
enough for day-to-day physical activity.

With that said, my awareness of the existence of Einsteinian
relativity and quantum mechanics means that in situations where we are
talking about high speeds or small distances, I don't rely on the
Newtonian model but think deliberately and look things up. These
situations don't arise often for day-to-day physical activity though!

### Aristotelian mechanics: retirable (for me) (IMHO)

[Aristotelian
physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelian_physics) is a
model of physics associated with Aristotle, that closely approximates
a lot of people's *intuitive* notion of mechanics. It stands in
contrast with Newtonian (classical) mechanics. Eliezer Yudkowsky
highlights key differences between the Aristotelian and the Newtonian
through the medium of storytelling in [HPMOR chapter
59](https://hpmor.com/chapter/59):

For me, I'd say that Aristotelian physics is a retirable
abstraction. That's because Newtonian mechanics is much more accurate
in the real world, while also being easy enough (for me) to
compute. Two simple examples: Newtonian mechanics highlights the fact
that your stopping distance grows as the *square* of your speed, which
means when you double your speed, you have to *not double but
quadruple* the distance you maintain from the person/vehicle/thing in
front of you. Newtonian mechanics notes that the kinetic energy grows
as the *square* of your speed, which means that doubling your speed
can *quadruple* the energy impact if you get into a collision.

## Chemistry and the nature of matter

### Classical elements: retirable IMHO

The four [classical
elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element) are earth,
water, air, and fire. Given our substantially better understanding of
chemistry and the nature of matter, I claim that the classical
elements are a retirable abstraction as far as practical science
goes. With that said, they might still be useful as a literary
vehicle!

### Alchemy: retirable IMHO

[Alchemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy) is the
protoscientific tradition that pre-dates modern chemistry. I don't
know a lot about alchemy; my vague understanding is that pretty much
all the valuable insights from alchemy have already been absorbed into
modern chemistry.

And some aspects of it, such as [converting other metals to
gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysopoeia), is correctly
recognized as not feasible now with the methods being originally
tried. With our modern understanding, nuclear reactions are needed to
convert one element to another, and these reactions tend to be
infeasible in most circumstances and have large amounts of energy
input or output even when feasible.

### Physical chemistry of the kind taught in high school / college: not retirable IMHO

Physical chemistry at the level that is taught in high school /
college is not retirable as far as I'm concerned, even though it's
probably only a crude approximation to the more accurate theories that
fall out of a modern understanding of quantum mechanics. In
particular, physical chemistry concepts such as solubility,
reduction/oxidation, pH (acids/bases), diffusion of gases, reversible
reactions and their kinetics and equilibirum etc. are useful
background information to understand the natural, synthetic, and
biological worlds.
