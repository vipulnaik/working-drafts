# Steady states and crunch times

In this blog post, I describe two related concepts in the context of
one's personal life and the balance of various pieces in that life.

I use the term *steady state* for a general pattern of balance that a
person opts into for an extended period of time, between various
aspects in the person's life. These aspects may incllude things such
as work, diet, exercise, relationships, creative expression, and
relaxation/entertainment. I describe this in more detail in the next
section.

I use the term *crunch time* for a period in a person's life when the
person deviates significantly from the steady state prior to that
deviation, for reasons that seem justified to the person. A crunch
time may occur for many reasons such as a health issue, a deadline at
work, a life transition (such as a job loss or job change, moving
houses, getting into or out of a relationship, or having kids), or
major social upheaval (such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the
significant increase in social distancing as a result).

This post covers thoughts on what crunch times look like, how to
navigate it, and what the process of returning to steady state looks
like.

## Steady states

A steady state represents a balance between various aspects of a
person's life, as determined by the person based on that person's
situation and values. The balance should be sustainable at least in
the medium term (e.g., several months to several years).

### Various aspects in a steady state

The list of categories below is not intended to be comprehensive, but
merely to be illustrative of the kinds of things that need to be
balanced in a steady state.

* **Work**: The person's quantity and nature of work are at a level
  sustainable for a reasonably long period of time (such as several
  months to several years)

* **Diet**: The person's diet is a sustainable compromise after taking
  into account such factors as health and nutrition, desired body
  shape and size, taste, financial cost, time cost (of purchase and
  preparation), and ethics.

* **Exercise**: The person's physical (and mental) exercise level is a
  sustainable compromise after taking into account such factors as
  overall health, desired body shape and size, financial cost of
  exercise equipment, weather conditions (that might affect the
  ability to do certain kinds of physical exercise), and time cost of
  exercise.

* **Relationships**: The person's quality and quantity of time and energy
  devoted to relationships important to the person is sustainable:
  it's not so little as to jeopardize the relationship and not so much
  as to eat into other things.

* **Creative expression**: The person feel enough freedom, in terms of
  both time and other resources, to express creative thoughts, whether
  as blog posts, or poems, or paintings, or music.

* **Social interaction**: The person's social interaction is within a
  range that is a reasonable compromise given the social needs of the
  communities the person wants to be part of, the person's own social
  needs, and the financial cost and time cost of the social
  interaction.

* **Relaxation/entertainment**: The person is able to achieve a sustainable
  compromise in terms of the time and type of
  relaxation/entertainment, after considering things like financial
  cost and time cost.

The items in the list are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For
instance, some people's work may include a lot of exercise, and many
people's work may include creative expression and social interaction
on a regular basis. For people who are engaged in creative
collaboration with their close friends, the categories of
relationships, creative expression, and social interaction might
overlap. For people who feel relaxed by social interaction, the
categories of social interaction and relaxation/entertainment overlap.

### Steady state as a psychological feeling more than any universal threshold

Two different people in steady state may choose to balance the various
aspects of life completely differently from each other. Even the same
person may choose very different balances at different points in
life. For instance, one person may work four hours a week and spend
the rest of the time with family; another may be a workaholic and do
maintenance levels of other activities.

The key distinguishing factor of a steady state is psychological: the
person doesn't legitimately feel something like: "Oh, let me delay
figuring this out by another two months because life will be more
balanced by then."

## Crunch times

A crunch time is a period in a person's life when the person deviates
significantly from the steady state prior to that deviation, for
reasons that seem justified to the person. So, this is not just about
a person randomly losing a sense of discipline in life and becoming
more careless about diet or exercise; this is about some concrete
thing going on due to which the person legitimately feels that the
balance created in the previous steady state is untenable.

### The new steady state may or may not be similar to the old steady state

The steady state that the person arrives at after the crunch time may
be pretty similar to the person's old steady state, or it may be
something very different. What the case is depends on the nature of
the change in the person's life.

For instance, if a person is switching jobs or houses, but the new
job/house is qualitatively similar to the old job/house in the
relevant ways, then the new steady state may be very similar to the
old steady state. So the crunch time is just a temporary deviation
from a mostly unchanged steady state. For instance, for a house move,
the period of the move may be one where the person eats out more and
exercises less, because of logistical challenges with eating at home
and exercising. But once the move is completed, the person may be able
to revert to the old diet and exercise pattern.

On the other hand, some transitions result in having to rethink the
steady state. Some examples: getting a chronic health ailment, having
a kid, or starting a job that is qualitatively different from the old
one, or moving to a very different kind of place (for instance, moving
from a dense urban area to a sparse rural area). In such cases, there
is both a crunch time associated with the transition, as well as a
longer-term recalibration of steady state, that often happens in
parallel. Even though both happen in parallel, it may be helpful to
conceptually distinguish the two, so as not to let the transitional
crunch be a factor in deciding the new steady state.

### Intensity and duration of crunch times

Crunch times can vary in their intensity (how severely they deviate
from the steady state) and duration (how long they last). While it's
possible to have crunch times that are severe in intensity and long in
duration, this is relatively rare; in general, there is an
intensity/duration trade-off.

At the one extreme are acute crunch times that may last less than a
week, but are very intense for that week. At the other extreme are
extended crunch times that last several months, but require relatively
smaller deviation from steady state.

Some crunch times are a superposition of acute and extended: there is
a relatively acute peak period of high intensity and short duration,
and a longer period of slight deviation from steady state. For
instance, for a house move, the week of the actual physical move is
the acute period, whereas the weeks before and after that, involving
changing addresses, setting up services, buying extra stuff to furnish
the new place, getting rid of junk from the old place, etc. correspond
to the more extended but less intense portion.

### Example causes of crunch times

Here are some possible causes of crunch times:

* **Sickness and health issues**: Sometimes, people experience
  physical and mental health issues that reduce their *total
  capacity*, so the balance that made sense previously needs to be
  rethought. The health issue may be temporary (for instance, an
  infectious disease with an approximately known recovery timeline) or
  chronic or unclear. Even in the chronic case, the period immediately
  following having the issue will be different from the longer term:
  the initial period will likely be heavy on diagnosis effort and
  experimentation with treatments and palliative remedies.

* **Deadline at work**: Sometimes, there are crunches associated with
  one's day job. These crunches could mean a need to work overtime, or
  to put in a greater quality of focus at work, for a brief period of
  time. This means that at least for that period of time, the person
  has less capacity for other aspects of life.

* **Sudden job loss**: A job loss (for instance, getting terminated
  from a job, or one's employer shutting down) can be a crunch time
  for several reasons. First, a lot of effort may need to be directed
  to the search for another job. Second, the financial calculus may
  change significantly, necessitating changes to various other
  trade-offs (for instance, a reduction in eating out, a reduction in
  some forms of expensive entertainment, perhaps a change to one's
  living situation to cut down on housing costs). Third, in some cases
  the job loss could have an emotional impact, depending on the exact
  circumstances, that might make it difficult to maintain life's
  previous balance. Fourth, there may be implications for social
  interactions and relationships.

* **Planned job change**: A planned job change can be a crunch time as
  it involves a mix of transitioning out of the old job and
  transitioning into the new job.

* **Moving houses**: A house move means a bunch of physical work
  moving things, packing and unpacking, as well as a bunch of
  logistical coordination around address changes and setting up
  services at the new house. It also involves a search process for
  stuff near the new house, such as shops, neighborhood activities,
  jogging tracks, etc.

* **Getting into a relationship**: The initial phase of getting into a
  relationship involves a bunch of learning about the other person or
  about various aspects of oneself. A bunch of time is spent with the
  other person that may leave less time for other
  activities. Moreover, there may be a discovery process of figuring
  out how to balance the preferences of the other person in the
  relationship, with one's own past trade-offs (for instance, around
  diet, if you cook and eat along with the other person).

* **Having a kid**: Having a kid has major implications for one's
  lifestyle, and the transitional period is a particularly crunchy
  time because of the significant adjustment needed to the physical
  space of the house as well as one's waking and sleeping routine.

## Navigating crunch times

Every crunch time is different, so not a lot can be said in full
generality about navigating crunch times. Nonetheless, I think there
are a few broad ideas that can be helpful, and I describe them below.

### Understanding preferences around intensity versus duration, to the extent these can be traded off

If you prefer a short, intense, acute crunch time, over a long and
more mild one, then you may be able to arrange things that
way. Inversely, if you prefer a long and relatively mild crunch time,
you may be able to arrange that too. For instance, for a house move,
there is an intense period of the physical move, but you have
flexibility about whether to do the other moving-related stuff at the
same time, or spread it out over a longer time period.

My own preference has been to spread crunch times over periods of up
to six weeks, except for cases where there are significant time
efficiencies of taking the acute approach.

### Setting deadlines with appropriate flexibility

There are several aspects of this:

* In some cases, if the default deadline (possibly imposed from
  outside) makes the crunch feel too intense, I request an extension
  to give me a bit more time. There is still a deadline, but it's that
  little bit more relaxed, which means that the intensity of the
  deviation from steady state is within an acceptable range. In many
  cases, the other party is happy to grant an extension, though there
  may be some financial cost to it (for instance, getting an extension
  of a few days for a house move may mean having to pay double rent
  for those extra days).

* In addition to external deadlines, it also helps to have an internal
  "return-to-steady-state-by" date; this is a date by which you expect
  to return to steady state. In my personal experience, I have found
  it helpful to have this date about one or two months after the
  planned end of the clearly identified crunch time period. What's the
  reason for that buffer? Partly, it has to do with "catching up"
  time; when the crunch time ends, I may have a bunch of catching up
  to do on things that I deferred to make way for the crunch.

  For instance, if I'm moving houses at the end of February, and
  expect to be mostly done with setup at the new place by the end of
  March, I might set my "return-to-steady-state-by" date as May 15.

* Once I have decided on a "return-to-steady-state-by" date, I try to
  make a point of trying to avoid taking on an obligation for any
  discretionary tasks (where I have flexibility) until the
  "return-to-steady-state-by" date. While I might still end up doing
  some of these discretionary tasks spontaneously, I do so only to the
  extent that are good reasons based on time-sensitivity and mood.

  For instance, if a friend is visiting from out of town and may not
  come again for several years, it is a time-sensitive situation and I
  may decide to meet up with the friend before my
  "return-to-steady-state-by" date. Or if somebody needs advice on a
  time-sensitive situation in their life, I might do so. On the other
  hand, I might not proactively reach out to old friends living in my
  town to try to arrange meetups, until after the
  "return-to-steady-state-by" date.

### Making temporary compromises on various aspects of life during the crunch time

I describe here some examples of the sorts of compromises I have made
during crunch times, and my thinking around these.

* **Diet**: During my house move, I ended up eating out more than
  usual, mostly due to logistical challenges around cooking/eating
  when my stuff was in transit, as well as the desire to not have to
  throw away food at the time of move. This was a wortwhile trade-off,
  but the frequency and type of outside food I ate at the time was not
  something I would like to continue in a steady state.

  During a crunch time at my job, I've shifted to getting more outside
  food, so that I can reduce the frequency of meal prep at home from
  once every ~4 days to once every week. The greater amount of outside
  food saved me some time, but did have a slight additional financial
  cost as well as some cost in terms of health and nutrition as well
  as taste satisfaction (I do like the outside food, but only at a
  somewhat lower frequency). This was a worthwhile trade-off all
  things considered, but not suitable as a steady state.

* **Exercise**: During my house move, I stopped explicit physical
  exercise partly for reasons of time availability, but also because
  the moving did involve a bunch of physical activity (including a lot
  of walking and a lot of carrying things), so exercising on top of
  that was fatiguing. In this case, the trade-off in terms of physical
  health was attenuated because moving itself did substitute for
  exercise. So what I missed most about exercise was the relaxed and
  low-stakes format of it, where I would be exerting my body purely
  for my body, rather than for instrumental reasons. Stopping exercise
  was therefore a decent trade-off under the circumstances but not
  good as a steady state.

* **Recordkeeping**: I didn't list recordkeeping as an aspect of
  people's lives in general, because it's not necessarily that salient
  for most people, but it is important to me. For instance, I maintain
  a record of my [daily updates](https://updates.vipulnaik.com/),
  [contract work for me](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/), and my
  [entertainment consumption](https://ese.vipulnaik.com/). The
  recordkeeping does not take a lot of time, but during crunch times,
  even the small amount of time they take is something I want to save.

  In these cases, my preference is to make a trade-off where I *delay*
  the recordkeeping, so that I am eventually caught up with it, rather
  than just miss out on the recordkeeping. This means that I maintain
  enough of the records that I can backfill the rest later. For
  instance, in the case of entertainment consumption, I just record a
  very minimal version of the data (name of item, start date of
  consumption, end date of consumption) from which I can fill the rest
  in later. I also may set limits on how significant a backlog I can
  develop for various kinds of recordkeeping, based on data
  availability considerations.
