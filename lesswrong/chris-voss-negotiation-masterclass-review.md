# Chris Voss negotiation MasterClass: review

This post is about the [negotiation MasterClass taught by Chris
Voss](https://www.masterclass.com/classes/chris-voss-teaches-the-art-of-negotiation)
and more broadly about the techniques and worldviews shared in that
MasterClass. I [watched this MasterClass in April
2020](https://ese.vipulnaik.com/#consumptionList).

My post discusses some of the relationship -- similarities and
differences -- with rationalist advice. These portions should be of
particular relevance to LessWrong and are part of the reason for
posting to LessWrong.

This is a fairly lengthy post, so please use the sections to navigate
to the portions you are most interested in.

I cover a lot in this review:

* What is this a review of?
* Why am I doing this review?
* Worldview
* Negotiation strategy
* Negotiation techniques

## What is this a review of?

### Who is Chris Voss?

[Christopher Voss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Voss)
worked ta the FBI as a lead hostage negotiator. In 2008 he left to
form his own company, The Black Swan Group, that offers coaching to
people on negotiation techniques.

### What is MasterClass?

[MasterClass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MasterClass) is a player
in the growing edutainmment space, combining education and
entertainment. There are 100+ "classes" in MasterClass. Each class is
taught by a subject matter expert (the teacher), and includes several
videos (changing from 2 to 30 minutes, usually 5 to 20 minutes). The
typical video format just includes the teacher speaking to the camera,
but there are occasionally interactive sessions with other
participants, or other co-instructors.

Course notes can be downloaded. There are also community features on
MasterClass.

You may have seen video ads for MasterClass on YouTube!

### What does this cost?

A MasterClass annual subscription all-access pass costs $180. A single
MasterClass can be purchased for $90.

### Are there other ways of accessing the information without paying for the subscription?

You may be able to sign up for a free week; however, I'm not sure what subset of the videos in the MasterClass are available. More details [here](https://donotpay.com/learn/masterclass-free-trial).

For the particular material covered in Chris Voss's MasterClass, many
of them can individually be found discussed elsewhere on the web,
including in videos from Chris Voss. I have more links for each of the
individual tactics.

[Masterwiki.how](https://masterwiki.how/) can be a helpful free
version of MasterClass, but it does not seem to have Chris Voss's
MasterClass.

### What are some interactive discussions where these techniques are critically examined?

The MasterClass is mostly just Chris Voss speaking, with nobody challenging him. I like to see pepole questioned about their ideas, ideally with question that I have or would have if I thought more about it. Since watching the MasterClass, I've [watched several interviews of Chris Voss](https://ese.vipulnaik.com/#consumptionList) that I list below:

* [Master the Art of Negotiating in Business and Life: Lewis Howes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pd7tjnVYMzY)
* [#MasterClassLive with Chris Voss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZcBuSCT3Io)
* [The Knowledge Project #27 â€” Chris Voss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHjUApypNsU)
* [WHY SUCCESS Comes From Mastering Negotiation In BUSINESS & LIFE | Chris Voss & Lewis Howes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_iKeiPhisw)

## Why am I doing this review?

### I think the MasterClass and the material it covered were pretty good

Chris Voss's MasterClass was the main reason I signed up for
MasterClass, and I finished it within a day after signing up. I liked
it quite a bit then. Over time, and after having thought about its
ideas and watched other related material, I continue to think the
ideas are pretty good.

I do not make claims about how much of the material originated from
Voss versus was learned by him from others (including the FBI
manual). Regardless of Voss's role as innovator versus peddler, the
stuff covered is good.

### I have already shared several tidbits of insight I learned with friends, but would like to have a public write-up

Several of the ideas I learned from the MasterClass, I've already
shared with friends. However, given that the MasterClass is paywalled,
I think it would be helpful to have a public write-up of the ideas
that I cam link to. A public write-up could benefit people outside my
inner circle of friends.

### I broadly think the LessWrong community should be more aware of and engage with these bodies of knowledge

Rationality offers a powerful way of viewing the world, but there are
also large bodies of knowledge around human interaction developed by
others. Fruitful exploration of these bodies of knowledge can help
enhance and deepen our rationality.

## Worldview

### Outward focus

Negotiation tactics are mostly focused outward: they're focused on how
to deal with other people, not how to deal with yourself.

A large part of the focus of rationality is inward: how to reason
better, how to tame and use your emotions, howo to achieve
goals. Similarly, many techniques such as meditation and relaxation
techniques have an inward focus too.

With negotiation tactics, one's own goals obviously matter, but the
goals of the other person are front-and-center.

There are a couple of ways that negotiation tactics relate to
inward-focused activities. First, in principle it is possible to apply
some negotiation tactics in self-negotiation. Interestingly, some such
applications have crude similarities to self-talk techniques (such as
CBT or EFT).

Second, in order to negotiate effectively with others, it generally
helps to have taken care of yourself *before* that. The idea is that
in a negotiation, the counterpart and the situation take center
stage. If you're bringing your own baggage to the situation, though,
it becomes harder to apply best principles of keeping the focus on the
situation and making the counterpart feel heard and addressed.

The negotiation MasterClass does not discuss the first point; it does
bring up some ideas related to the second point but indirectly.

### Dealing with people who do not aspire to epistemic virtues

The negotiation techniques in the MasterClass grew out of efforts to
deal with hostage kidnappers, and evolved to address difficult
business negotiations. These people aren't necessarily irrational, but
they are not aspiring to epistemic virtues. Pointing out their
cognitive biases will not make them thank you for helping them achieve
their epistemic goals.

The negotiation techniques therefore can be quite different from norms
recommended for rationalist cultures, where there is an assumption
that all parties are aspiring toward epistemic virtue. For instance,
"tell culture" can be great as a rationalist norm but would contradict
many aspects of negotiation techniques.

One concern we might have about negotiation techniques is that they
specifically *rely* on the irrationality of one's counterparts, and so
would fall flat or even backfire in more epistemically virtuuos
environments. After thinking about the various techniques, I think
this actually isn't much of a concern, as long as the person applying
the negotiation techniques adjusts the mix effectively based on what
is needed. Broadly, I do not think these negotiation techniques are
what is sometimes called the "dark arts" on LessWrong (though they
probably could be interpreted as such!).

### Emotion-focused or cognitively focused?

While Voss gives a lot of importance to emotions, I think it would be
wrong to think of the negotiation techniques as primarily
emotion-focused. Rather, I think the negotiation techniques try to
pick at underlying motivations, some of which could be emotions! I
think there is a moderately sound cognitive and epistemic grounding
for the negotiation techniques, though the role of human emotions is
very important to understanding how successful the techniques will be.

### Greater applicability to synchronous interactions

Many of the negotiation techniques are applicable to synchronous
interactions, including in-person and phone interactions. In general,
the techniques seem optimized for high-bandwidth communication with
frequent back-and-forth.

### Mirroring

Mirroring is the technique of repeating about 1 to 3 words of the last
sentence the other person said.
