I don't think Karan Johar produced DDLJ or Chennai Express???
I apologize, You are correct. Karan Johar did not produce Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (DDLJ) or Chennai Express, My mistake on that.
DDLJ was produced by Yash Raj Films and directed by Aditya Chopra. While Chennai Express was produced by Red Chillies Entertainment, directed by Rohit Shetty and distributed by UTV Motion Pictures.
While Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania and the other two films I mentioned all were produced by Karan Johar under the production banner of Dharma productions.

And both of them shares the same "journey of love" trope as well as both of them were commercial hit and well received by the audiences.
The main similarity between the three movies is that all these movies are romantic comedies with a similar kind of structure and deals with similar themes of tradition, family and love.

There are actually two scenes of that sort in DDLJ. Can you tell me about both?
Yes, you are correct. There are two scenes in Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (DDLJ) that feature characters catching a train in a similar way.
The first one is the one I described earlier, where Simran runs to catch the train and Raj extends his hand to help her aboard the moving train. This scene takes place in the first act of the film and sets up the main romance between Raj and Simran.
The second scene is when the two characters meet again after many days at the station where Raj is trying to stop the train in which simran is traveling by stretching his arms and trying to touch her hand.This scene happens in the end of the second act where Raj tries to win Simran's love back.
Both of these scenes are iconic and memorable for their romantic gestures and for the symbolism they convey about the characters and their relationship. Both these scenes are considered as the most romantic and iconic moment in the film.
In both these scenes, you can see the "hero" reaching out to help the "heroine" and trying to make a connection, which ultimately becomes the foundation of their love story.
