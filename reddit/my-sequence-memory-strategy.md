# My sequence memory strategy

For Human Benchmark subreddit (drafted in Reddit with WYSIWIG editor,
converted to markdown, and pasted here):

I've been practicing sequence memory for a while and have come up with an approach that seems to work well. My untrained scores were in the 13-20 range (for the most part) and over time my scores have improves, and of late I've been scoring 20+ consistently, with my two latest scores being 42 and 36. Here are some of the strategies that work.

**Chunking**

I do the obvious thing of chunking the sequence; I use chunk sizes of four so I remember sets of four adjacent digits (the final chunk can have 1 to 4 digits based on the parity of the level). I mostly use numerical encoding in my head (using the keypad encoding for the 3 X 3), with the visual movements stored as a backup method.

**When watching the sequence unfold (once the sequence has gotten long enough)**

I have roughly three different strategies depending on where in the sequence I am:

* The early part, that has been committed to memory pretty well: When the early part is playing, I rest my eyes and brain, so that it gets much-needed rest and doesn't spend energy unnecessarily. I might just watch it peripherally.
* The middle part, that is largely committed to memory but can benefit from active recall: For this part, I  actively try to recall it as it is playing, and if there are any errors in my recollection that's feedback for me to strengthen/reiterate those parts in my head.
* The end, which is new or almost-new: For the end, what I do is repeat those last few digits in my head right after they play, a few times, so that they're committed to my working memory even though they haven't really been fully organized in there.

**When clicking the sequence, I make sure to go moderately slow**

It's important to go slow when clicking. In particular:

* As the sequence gets longer and longer, there's more risk of accidentally pressing the wrong square due to a temporary memory confusion or just a misclick. Going slow protects somewhat against this. If the early and middle parts of the sequence are well-encoded in my memory, going slow should not be a problem.
* Also, when I am clicking the sequence myself, there is no time pressure (unlike when it's being shown to me) which means I have time to not just click the sequence, but also reinforce it in my own memory. So I try to use this time well to strengthen the parts that I had trouble recalling, without time pressure.
