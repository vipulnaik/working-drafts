==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

A nontrivial [[group]] is said to be '''splitting-simple''' or '''semidirectly indecomposable''' or '''inseparable''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:

* It cannot be expressed as a [[semidirect product]] of nontrivial groups
* It has no proper nontrivial [[defining ingredient::retract]]
* It has no proper nontrivial [[defining ingredient::complemented normal subgroup]]

{{obtainedbyapplyingthe|simple group operator|retract}}

The [[group property]] of being semidirectly indecomposable is obtained by applying the [[simple group operator]] to the subgroup property of being a retract (the simple group operator takes a subgroup property and outputs the property of being a group where there is no proper nontrivial subgroup having that property).

It is also obtained by applying the simple group operator to the subgroup property of being a complemented normal subgroup.
