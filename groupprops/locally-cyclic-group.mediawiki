{{group property}}

==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

A [[group]] is termed '''locally cyclic''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:

# Every [[finitely generated group|finitely generated]] subgroup of the group is [[cyclic group|cyclic]].
# The subgroup generated by any two elements of the group is cyclic.
# It is isomorphic to a [[subquotient]] (i.e., a [[quotient group]] of a [[subgroup]]) of the [[group of rational numbers]].
# Its [[lattice of subgroups]] is a distributive lattice. In other words, the operations of [[join of subgroups]] and [[intersection of subgroups]] distribute over each other.

===Equivalence of definitions===

{{further|[[Locally cyclic iff subquotient of rationals]], [[Locally cyclic iff distributive lattice of subgroups]]}}

(1) and (2) are clearly equivalent. For the equivalence of (1) and (2) with (3), refer [[locally cyclic iff subquotient of rationals]]. For the equivalence with (4), refer [[locally cyclic iff distributive lattice of subgroups]].

=== Weaker properties conditional to nontriviality ===

The following properties are weaker if we restrict to nontrivial groups.

{| class="sortable" border="1"
! Property !! Meaning !! Proof of implication !! Proof of strictness (reverse implication failure) !! Intermediate notions
|-
| [[Stronger than::splitting-simple group]] || has no proper nontrivial [[complemented normal subgroup]] || || || {{intermediate notions short|splitting-simple group|locally cyclic group}}
|-
| [[Stronger than::directly indecomposable group]] || has no proper nontrivial [[direct factor]] || || || {{intermediate notions short|directly indecomposable group|locally cyclic group}}
|}
