==Definition==

===Symbol-free definition===

A nontrivial [[group]] is said to be '''directly indecomposable''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:

* It has no proper nontrivial [[direct factor]]
* It cannot be expressed as an [[external direct product]] of nontrivial groups

===Definition with symbols===

A [[group]] <math>G</math> is said to be '''directly indecomposable''' if we cannot write <math>G</math> as:

<math>G \cong H \times K</math>

with both <math>H</math> and <math>K</math> being nontrivial groups.

==Formalisms==

{{obtainedbyapplyingthe|simple group operator|direct factor}}

The group property of being directly indecomposable is obtained by applying the [[simple group operator]] to the [[subgroup property]] of being a [[direct factor]].

==Facts==

===Products of directly indecomposable groups===

It is clear that every finite group can be expressed as a product of directly indecomposable groups. The question: is this expression as a product essentially unique? That is, is there an analogue of unique factorization for direct products? The answer is yes, as per the [[Remak-Schmidt theorem]].
