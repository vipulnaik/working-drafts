==Big picture==

{| class="wikitable"
! Time period !! Development summary !! More details 
|-
| 2003 || Early days || The documentary "Being Terri", about a child who was badly burned in a fire, airs on British television. This documentary inspires Rob Mather to start the fundraising event "Swim For Terri", which would morph into World Swim Against Malaria (which would later become the Against Malaria Foundation).
|-
| 2004–2005 || Establishment of World Swim Against Malaria || Following the initial "Swim For Terri" event, Mather keeps the idea of swimming as a fundraiser but changes the target to fighting malaria through the purchase of bednets. AMF is established as the World Swim for Malaria Foundation (but called "World Swim Against Malaria"), and a fundraiser takes place in December 2005.
|-
| 2006–2008 || Continued growth || The first bednet distributions due to AMF take place in mid-2006. Throughout this period, bednet distributions due to AMF would expand into numerous countries, and various fundraisers take place (both swim and non-swim). By mid-2007, AMF would formally change its name to the current "Against Malaria Foundation".
|-
| 2009–present || Discovery and recommendation by effective altruist organizations || Contact between AMF and the charity evaluator GiveWell takes place around April 2009. By July 2009, GiveWell lists AMF as a "recommended organization", and in 2010 GiveWell ranks AMF a "Silver Medal organization". Other evaluator organizations associated with the effective altruism movement follow in their recommendation of AMF. Since 2010, in every year except 2013, GiveWell has listed AMF as a top charity.

<!--
TODO:

- what were rob mather and andrew garner doing before AMF? very little info of them anywhere.
- when was the AMF malaria advisory group established?
- "changes to the distribution guidelines and post-distribution checkup rules" -- kinda hard to find exact dates around this, imo.
- keep track of max nets distributed per distribution?
- tax deductibility event for Switzerland through EAF; this page https://www.againstmalaria.com/CharityStatus.aspx does not list a date or documentation for this, so it is unclear when this happened.
- when did it hire the two other people? and how many people does it have anyway?
- the other occurrences of "madness against malaria". During which years did this happen?

==Evolution of cost-per-life-saved estimates==

GiveWell's estimate of the cost-per-life-saved equivalent for AMF has varied over the years. The estimates are summarized below.

In a blog post, GiveWell clarifies that its estimates in recent years have not been of the cost to save a life, but rather of the cost to do good equivalent to saving a life:<ref>{{cite web|url = https://blog.givewell.org/2016/12/12/amf-population-ethics/|title = AMF and Population Ethics|last = Cotra|first = Ajeya|date = December 12, 2016|accessdate = November 24, 2017}}</ref>

{{quote|That is, our cost-effectiveness estimate does not predict that if you give $3400 to AMF you will, on expectation, prevent the death of one young child. It predicts that if you give $3400 to AMF, you will on expectation cause a combination of outcomes that, according to the values of the median GiveWell staff member, are morally equivalent to saving the life of one young child.}}
