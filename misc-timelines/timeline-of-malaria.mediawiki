'''[[wikipedia:Malaria|Malaria]]''' is an infectious disease caused by a parasite; it is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito. Every year, 300 to 700 million people get infected. Malaria kills 1 million to 2 million people every year. 90% of the deaths occur in Africa.<ref name=WHO15>{{cite web|title=Malaria Fact sheet N°94|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/|publisher=[[wikipedia:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]]|accessdate=2 February 2016}}</ref>
