! Period !! Key developments
|-
| Before 1945 || The idea of the Transbay Tube has been floated, and there has been some discussion of improving Bay Area transit options, but no concrete steps.
|-
| 1945–1957 || A series of statutes, commissions/working groups, and reports paves the way for the concept of and initial funding for a publicly funded, grade-separated, mass rapid transit system.
|-
| 1957–1964 || The initial years of the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BARTD) involve a successful public relations campaign to secure large-scale funding and a full-fledged system plan. BARTD also successfully weathers the first lawsuit against it.
|-
| 1964–1972 || This is the period between the beginning of BART construction and the opening of the first BART line for passenger use. The period involves the construction of the Transbay Tube, Berkeley Hills Tunnel, Oakland Wye, Market Street subway, and the rest of the initial BART system.
|-
| 1972–1976 || The initial batch of BART stations opens up. The last station to open up in this batch is Embarcadero, one of only two infill stations in the BART system, and also the most heavily used BART station. The period is marked by considerable criticism of BART for its poor safety procedures and below-expectations ridership.

|-
| 1947 || || Report || A joint review board by the United States Army and Navy concludes that an additional link is needed between San Francisco and Oakland to reduce congestion on the Bay Bridge. The proposed link is an underwater tube to carry high-speed electric trains.<ref name=bart-concept-born/><ref name=divided-loyalties-p25/> || Transbay Tube
|-
| 1949 || || Legislation || The California state legislature passes the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Rapid Transit District Act.<ref name=clr>{{cite web|url = http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2867&context=californialawreview|title = BART and the Victoria Line: A Comparison of New Commuter Transport in California and London|last = Griffith|first = John|last2 = Holmes|first2 = Dallas|date = August 1, 1967|accessdate = June 2, 2017|publisher = ''[[wikipedia:California Law Review|California Law Review]]''}}</ref> According to the Act, a specially created district would be needed to operate effectively in the context of multiple Bay Area governmental units. The Act provides that the district shall include the city and county of San Francisco and the cities of Alameda, Albany, Berkeley, Emeryville, Hayward, Oakland, Piedmont, and San Leandro, and may include all or any part of Marin, Sonoma, Napa, Solano, Contra Costa, Alameda, San Mateo, and Santa Clara Counties and any city situated therein. In total, over seventy county, city and county, and city governments are potentially involved.<ref name=clr/> || 
|-
| 1950 || March || Report || The Oakland City Planning Commission submits a preliminary report to the mayors and managers of the cities in the East Bay, with an analysis of and suggested improvements to the Key System local bus service. The report emphasizes the need for a publicly owned rapid transit system on grade-separated rights of way.<ref name=clr/> || 
|-
| 1951 || April || Report || The Senate Interim Committee on the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Rapid Transit Problems issues a report emphasizing the need for a rapid transit system of the kind envisioned by the Rapid Transit Act of 1949, and favors a publicly owned system over a privately owned one.<ref name=clr/> || 
|-
| 1951 || || Legislation || The California State Legislature passes a new statute, adding a Section 39 to the Rapid Transit Act of 1949.<ref name=clr/> It creates a 26-member San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit Commission, comprised of representatives from each of the nine counties which touch the Bay. The Commission's charge is to study the Bay Area's long range transportation needs in the context of environmental problems and then recommend the best solution.<ref name=clr/><ref name=bart-concept-born/><ref name=divided-loyalties-p25/> Both the joint Army/Navy report<ref name=divided-loyalties-p25/> and the efforts of BAC are credited for the legislature's decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uX_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA44|title = Urban Elites and Mass Transportation: The Dialectics of Power, Page 44|author = J.

|-
| 1953 || January || Report || A report prepared by the Rapid Transit Commission with the help of the consulting firm Deleuw, Cather & Co. is submitted to the California state legislature. The report is based on plans, data, and information from all the nine counties potentially covered by the Rapid Transit Act. The report argues that highways alone will not solve the transportation problems of the Bay Area, and pushes for mass rapid transit that has a low elapsed time from start to destination, and that can integrate well with other modes of transport.<ref name=clr/> The Senate Interim Committee endorses this report, and draws particular attention to four major interurban operators serving the Bay Area: Pacific Greyhound Lines, Key System Transit Lines, Southern Pacific Company, and Peerless Stages System.<ref name=clr/> || 
|-
| 1953 || November 4 || Legislation || The California state legislature passes another statute, appropriating $400,000 to enable the Rapid Transit Commission to make preliminary studies for the development of a coordinated master plan. The statute provides that the amount appropriated by the state is to be spent only if the nine counties appropriate an additional $350,000. This condition is fulfilled on November 4.<ref name=clr/> ||

| 1953 || November 12 || Report || Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Hall and Macdonald (PBHM) are commissioned for the study for which $750,000 was appropriated on November 4.<ref name=clr/><ref name=rrt/> ||
|-
| 1955 || || Report || The Senate Interim Committee on the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Rapid Transit Problems issues a report saying that the general transit situation in the Bay Area has deterioriated. Based on counts of the number of people who commute to work, it concludes that the Bay Area is a single economic unit and is in urgent need of a mass transit system.<ref name=clr/> ||
|-
| 1955 || || Legislation || The California state legislature extends the lifetime of the Rapid Transit Commission (that was created in 1951 and scheduled to end in 1955) to 1957, and allowing any unallocated portion of the previously appropriated $750,000 to be used for publicity of the Bay Area's transit problems.<ref name=clr/> ||
|-
| 1956 || January || Report || Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Hall and Macdonald (PBHM) present a report, ''Regional Rapid Transit'' (RRT) to the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit Commission, that was commissioned in November 1953.

|-
| 1962 || April || County coordination || San Mateo County opts out of BART, citing high costs, existing service provided by Southern Pacific commuter trains, and concerns over shoppers going to San Francisco, hurting local businesses. The withdrawal of San Mateo County leads to Daly City (just at the border between the counties) as the southwest terminus.<ref name=bart-concept-born/> ||
|-
| 1962 || May || County coordination || Following the withdrawal of San Mateo County, Marin County also withdraws, citing engineering objections and the potential for not getting enough votes. This leads to cancellation of the plans for a northwest terminus and the Geary Subway section of the system.<ref name=bart-concept-born/> ||

|-
| 1962 || November 6 || County coordination || The remaining three counties (Alameda, Contra Costa, and San Francisco) agree to the modified BART plan with a $792 million bond measure, with terminuses at Richmond, Concord, Fremont, and Daly City.<ref name=bart-40-years/><ref name=bart-concept-born/> The measure, known as Proposition A on the three-county ballot, is able to pass due to two changes engineered by Alan K. Browne of the Bank of America: (a) getting the state legislature to reduce the needed BART vote from 66.67% (the default) to 60%, and (b) allowing for the requirement of crossing the vote threshold to be applied to all votes together, rather than county-by-county. Without both these changes, the measure would not have passed.<ref name=urban-elites-p59>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uX_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA59|title = Urban Elites and Mass Transportation: The Dialectics of Power, Page 59|author = J.

Opponents include the Civil League of Improvement and Associations that opposes the taxes needed, the Central Council of Civic Clubs and the San Francisco Labor Council that have more specific objections, and some automobile and older railroad companies, though these companies do not spend resources on opposing the bond measure. || 
|-
| 1962 || November 29 || Work contracts || BART signs a new contract with the successors to the firms it had contracted with to come up with a design for the system. The new contract is for overall system planning through research and development, design, and management of construction. The contract is with the engineering joint venture firm composed of Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade, and Douglas (the successor to Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Hall, and MacDonald), Tudor and Bechtel. In short, the joint venture to which the work is contracted is called PBTB.<ref name="Ethics Center"/><ref name=bart-begins/> ||
|-
| 1962/1963 || || Lawsuit || Robert L. Osborne, an Oakland city councilman and East Bay manufacturer, files a lawsuit against BARTD arguing that fixed rail is obsolete, that BART stations would be too far apart to encourage riders, that better and more efficient transit systems were rejected by BARTD, that the ultimate cost would exceed the $792 million approved, that BARTD's contract with PBTB is open-ended and illegal and based on nepotism, and that an illegal, close working relationship exists between the Citizens for Rapid Transit Committee and BART public officials.<ref name=clr/> The court first eliminates some of the allegations, then after hearing the plaintiff's case at trial the court rules against the plaintiff.<ref name=clr/> Many of these allegations would later prove true.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uX_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA63|title = Urban Elites and Mass Transportation: The Dialectics of Power, Page 63|author = J.

| 1966 || October || Construction, Referendum || Since 1965, the government of the city of [[wikipedia:Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] had been pressing BART to construct the Berkeley portion of the BART underground (instead of elevated), and said it is willing to pay the additional construction costs. The city government is concerned that an elevated track would reduce connectivity between the black population of South Berkeley and the rest of the city, and reduce prices in the area. Due to disputes between Berkeley city engineers and BART engineers about the magnitude of additional costs, competitive bidding is opened up both for underground and elevated construction, and the city of Berkeley decides, after seeing the difference between the bids, to pay extra for underground construction. A referendum is held in October 1966, where the residents of Berkeley overwhelmingly vote in favor of underground construction and the corresponding tax increase (with 83% in favor, compared to the 75% that city officials were hoping for).<ref name=clr/> || Ashby, Berkeley, North Berkeley (stations in Berkeley)
