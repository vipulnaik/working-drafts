|-
| 1945 || || Organization || The San Francisco Bay Region Council is created by California's State Reconstruction and Re-Employment Commission.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uX_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA42|title = Urban Elites and Mass Transportation: The Dialectics of Power, Page 42|author = J. Allen Whitt}}</ref> Although funded by the state in its first year, the council incorporates as a private nonprofit organization, and changes its name to the [[wikipedia:Bay Area Council|Bay Area Council]]. Initial supporters of the now private BAC include [[wikipedia:Bank of America|Bank of America]], [[wikipedia:American Trust Company|American Trust Company]], [[wikipedia:Standard Oil|Standard Oil of California]], [[wikipedia:Pacific Gas & Electric|Pacific Gas & Electric]], [[wikipedia:U.S. Steel|U.S. Steel]], and [[wikipedia:Bechtel Corporation|Bechtel Corporation]]. In subsequent years, BAC would be influential in pushing for transportation changes in the San Francisco Bay Area, including enhancements to the bridges as well as the ceration of BART.
|-
| 1946 || || Acquisition || The [[wikipedia:Key System Trasit Company|Key System Transit Company]], a private operator of electric trollies in the Bay Area, is acquired by National City Lines, a company representing automobile and bus interests, that wishes to eliminate electric trollies from the streets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uX_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA45|title = Urban Elites and Mass Transportation: The Dialectics of Power, Page 45|author = J. Allen Whitt}}</ref> The removal of a key alternative provider of mass transit would pave the way for mass transit solutions such as BART.
|-
| 1947 || || Report || A joint review board by the United States Army and Navy concludes that an additional link is needed between San Francisco and Oakland to reduce congestion on the Bay Bridge. The proposed link is an underwater tube to carry high-speed electric trains.<ref name=bart-concept-born/><ref name=divided-loyalties-p25/>
|-
| 1951 || || Report || The California State Legislature creates a 26-member San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit Commission, comprised of representatives from each of the nine counties which touch the Bay. The Commission's charge is to study the Bay Area's long range transportation needs in the context of environmental problems and then recommend the best solution.<ref name=bart-concept-born/><ref name=divided-loyalties-p25/> Both the joint Army/Navy report<ref name=divided-loyalties-p25/> and the efforts of BAC are credited for the legislature's decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uX_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA44|title = Urban Elites and Mass Transportation: The Dialectics of Power, Page 44|author = J.

|-
| 1956 || || Report || Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Hall and Macdonald (PBHM) present a report, ''Regional Rapid Transit'' (RRT) to the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit Commission. The report had been commissioned in 1953. This report is the first planning document for BART and would be the starting point for further reports.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uX_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA52|title = Urban Elites and Mass Transportation: The Dialectics of Power, Page 52|author = J.

|-
| 1957 || || Highway transportation || A number of citizens' groups protest freeway construction in San Francisco starting around this time, beginning with the Embarcadero Freeway. This leads to increased interest in mass rapid transit as an alternative.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uX_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA48|title = Urban Elites and Mass Transportation: The Dialectics of Power, Page 48|author = J.

|-
| 1957 || || County coordination || Based on the findings of the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit Commission, the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BARTD) is formed by the [[wikipedia:California|California]] state legislature, comprising the counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, and San Mateo. Santa Clara county is not included.<ref name=bart-concept-born>{{cite web|url = http://www.bart.gov/about/history/history|title = A History of BART: The Concept is Born|accessdate = May 28, 2017|publisher = [[wikipedia:Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]]}}</ref><ref name=divided-loyalties-p25>{{cite web|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NsRgNh35XPEC&pg=PA25#v=onepage&q=bay%20area%20rapid%20transit%20district&f=false|title = Divided Loyalties: Whistle-blowing at BART (Page 25)|author = Robert Morris Anderson}}</ref>
|-
| 1959 || May 14 || Work contracts || BART retains the services of the joint engineering venture composed of Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Hall and Macdonald, Tudor Engineering, and the Bechtel Corporation to develop a regional plan.<ref name=divided-loyalties>{{cite web|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NsRgNh35XPEC&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=bart+pbtb&source=bl&ots=my0IV7wkLm&sig=SpL3c3hqFXy3iSw9d-3I-DTp75I&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwie4Nzpj5TUAhUPw2MKHchmAbQQ6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&q=bart%20pbtb&f=false|title = BART, PBTB, and CSPE|accessdate = May 28, 2017}}</ref><ref name=urban-elites-p54>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uX_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA54|title = Urban Elites and Mass Transportation: The Dialectics of Power, Page 54|author = J.

|-
| 1959 || || Financing plan || A bill is passed in the California state legislature providing for financing of what would later become the [[wikipedia:Transbay Tube|Transbay Tube]] through surplus toll revenues from the [[wikipedia:San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge|San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]].
|-
| 1961 || || System plan || A final plan is sent to the boards of supervisors of the five counties. The system would have three endpoints in the East Bay: Concord, Richmond, and Fremont; one in the Northwest at Novato, and one in the South Bay at Palo Alto.<ref name=bart-concept-born/>
|-
| 1962 || April || County coordination || San Mateo County opts out of BART, citing high costs, existing service provided by Southern Pacific commuter trains, and concerns over shoppers going to San Francisco, hurting local businesses. The withdrawal of San Mateo County leads to Daly City (just at the border between the counties) as the southwest terminus.<ref name=bart-concept-born/>
|-
| 1962 || May || County coordination || Following the withdrawal of San Mateo County, Marin County also withdraws, citing engineering objections and the potential for not getting enough votes. This leads to cancellation of the plans for a northwest terminus and the Geary Subway section of the system.<ref name=bart-concept-born/>
|-
| 1962 || May || Report || The ''Composite Report'' (CR) is produced by the consortium of Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Hall and Macdonald, Tudor Engineering hired by BARTD in 1959.<ref name=urban-elites-p54/>
|-
| 1962 || November || County coordination || The remaining three counties (Alameda, Contra Costa, and San Francisco) agree to the modified BART plan with a $792 million bond measure, with terminuses at Richmond, Concord, Fremont, and Daly City.<ref name=bart-concept-born/> The measure, known as Proposition A on the three-county ballot, is able to pass due to two changes engineered by Alan K. Browne of the Bank of America: (a) getting the state legislature to reduce the needed BART vote from 66.67% (the default) to 60%, and (b) allowing for the requirement of crossing the vote threshold to be applied to all votes together, rather than county-by-county. Without both these changes, the measure would not have passed.<ref name=urban-elites-p59>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uX_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA59|title = Urban Elites and Mass Transportation: The Dialectics of Power, Page 59|author = J. Allen Whitt}}</ref> Supporters of the measure organize a campaign committee called Citizens for Rapid Transit, whose top members are San Francisco bankers.<ref name=urban-elites-p59/> In contrast, there is no organized opposition. Opponents include the Civil League of Improvement and Associations that opposes the taxes needed, the Central Council of Civic Clubs and the San Francisco Labor Council that have more specific objections, and some automobile and older railroad companies, though these companies do not spend resources on opposing the bond measure.
|-
| 1962 || November 29 || Work contracts || BART signs a new contract with the successors to the firms it had contracted with to come up with a design for the system. The new contract is for overall system planning through research and development, design, and management of construction. The contract is with the engineering joint venture firm composed of Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade, and Douglas (the successor to Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Hall, and MacDonald), Tudor and Bechtel. In short, the joint venture to which the work is contracted is called PBTB.<ref name="Ethics Center"/><ref name=bart-begins/>
|-
| 1962/1963 || || Lawsuit || Robert L. Osborne, an Oakland city councilman and East Bay manufacturer, files a lawsuit against BARTD arguing that fixed rail is obsolete, that BART stations would be too far apart to encourage riders, athat better and more efficient transit systems were rejected by BARTD, that the ultimate cost would exceed the $792 million approved, that BARTD's contract with PBTB is open-ended and illegal and based on nepotism, and that an illegal, close working relationship exists between the Citizens for Rapid Transit Committee and BART public officials. Many of these allegations would later prove true.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uX_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA63|title = Urban Elites and Mass Transportation: The Dialectics of Power, Page 63|author = J. Allen Whitt}}</ref>
