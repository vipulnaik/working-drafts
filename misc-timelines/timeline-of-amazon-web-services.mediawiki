{| class="wikitable sortable"
! Time period !! class="unsortable" | Key developments at Amazon Web Services
|-
| 2003–2005 || Amazon Web Services is in the planning and private beta phase. The blog is launched and EC2 is made available to select customers privately.
|-
| 2006–2007 || AWS releases its first product in the categories of storage (Amazon S3), compute (Amazon EC2), database (Amazon SimpleDB), and data flow (Amazon Simple Queue Service). The service remains in beta, in only one region, without the concept of availability zones.
|-
| 2008–2010 || AWS exits beta and offers a Service Level Agreement (SLA). It launches many new products to help with more logical and controlled infrastructure management as well as more redundancy and high availability. It introduces the concept of availability zones and elastic IPs, facilitating redundancy and availability, and launches new AWS regions. It also introduces core AWS features such as autoscaling, elastic load balancing, CloudWatch, CloudFront, Elastic Block Store, CloudFormation, Simple Notification Service, and Route 53. In this period, companies such as [[wikipedia:Reddit|Reddit]], [[wikipedia:Zynga|Zynga]], and [[wikipedia:Netflix|Netflix]] announce the intent to migrate to AWS, and a new generation of companies built on AWS from day one, including [[wikipedia:Pinterest|Pinterest]] and [[wikipedia:Airbnb|Airbnb]], gets started.
|-
| 2011–2013 || AWS continues expanding to more regions and adding to its product offerings in storage, compute, database, and other areas. Migration of existing companies to AWS and the building of new companies on AWS also continues. One emerging trend over this period is a growth of the AWS ecosystem, with tools like Netflix's Simian Army, and entire companies such as Cloudyn that help with understanding and navigating AWS. Competition from Microsoft and IBM also picks up, and Zynga announces its decision to move off AWS. High-profile AWS outages cause downtime for widely used websites that rely on AWS. 
|-
| 2014–2016 || AWS continues to grow and add new services and regions. It expands its focus to new areas, such as machine learning tools, Internet of Things, and providing physical infrastructure (such as Snowball and Snowmobile) to facilitate large-scale data migration to the cloud. It launches [[wikipedia:AWS Lambda|AWS Lambda]] and the EC2 Container Service, exploiting and helping further the trends of serverless architecture and containerization respectively. The regional expansions are couched more in terms of helping customers in different parts of the world achieve low latency and meet data privacy requirements to facilitate adoption. AWS loses [[wikipedia:Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]] but gains [[wikipedia:Salesforce.com|Salesforce.com]] and [[wikipedia:VMware|VMware]] as partners.

| 2000 || || Prelude || [[wikipedia:Amazon.com|Amazon.com]], the parent company of the as yet nonexistent AWS, begins work on merchant.com, an e-commerce platform intended for use by other large retailers such as [[wikipedia:Target Corporation|Target Corporation]]. In the process, Amazon's team realizes that they need to decouple their code better, with cleaner interfaces and access APIs. Around the same time, the company also realizes the need to build infrastructure-as-a-service internally, to improve the speed of development and not have it bottlenecked by infrastructure availability. All these changes help pave the way for AWS.<ref>{{cite web|url =https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/|title = How AWS came to be|date = July 2, 2016|accessdate = December 4, 2016|publisher = ''[[wikipedia:TechCrunch|TechCrunch]]''|last = Miller|first = Ron}}</ref><ref name=medium-jassy>{{cite web|url = https://medium.com/@furrier/original-content-the-story-of-aws-and-andy-jassys-trillion-dollar-baby-4e8a35fd7ed#.g4p7t635j|title = Exclusive: The Story of AWS and Andy Jassy’s Trillion Dollar Baby.

| 2019 || March 27 || Product (storage) || AWS announces a new storage class called Glacier Deep Archive, which it describes as a good fit for storing content over the long term at low cost (comparable to the cost of tapes) but with retrieval times of 12 hours. Rarely accessed content in Glacier may be a good fit for this use case.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-s3-storage-class-glacier-deep-archive/|title = New Amazon S3 Storage Class – Glacier Deep Archive|date = March 27, 2019|accessdate = April 13, 2019}}</ref>

== Meta information on the timeline ==

=== How the timeline was built ===

* The first iteration of the timeline was built by [[wikipedia:User:Simfish|Alex K. Chen]] with payment from Vipul Naik, who provided a little bit of guidance. The version as of the end of this iteration is [https://timelines.issarice.com/index.php?title=Timeline_of_online_advertising&oldid=11704 here].
* The second iteration was worked on by Vipul Naik, using the following methods:
** Extensive reading of the [https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/ AWS blog] and its archives, to get a sense of the types of product and service update announcements. Also, eyeballing through the posts in the [https://techcrunch.com/topic/product/amazon-web-services/ TechCrunch tag on Amazon Web Services].
** Completion of systematic coverage for all things in particular categories, such as: new region launches (just loaded up the list of regions and made sure a row is devoted to each), outages (scoured the Internet for list of major AWS outages and added them in), important products (relied on personal experience and hearsay on heaviest used AWS products).
** Coverage of third-party reviews of AWS, such as the Gartner report.
** More systematic coverage of major AWS users, their migration to and from AWS, or their start on AWS.

=== What the timeline is still missing ===

* Release information on products and services that the people who've edited the timeline so far didn't consider important.
* More insight into how competitor product release or advances in their cost structure, regional diversity or other aspects of their service have affected AWS.

=== Timeline update strategy ===

* Look for new items covered on the [https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/ AWS blog] and the [https://techcrunch.com/topic/product/amazon-web-services/ TechCrunch AWS tag] when doing a single-sitting mass update of the timeline since the last update.
* Add new region launches or other major product updates or outages, ideally as they happen.
