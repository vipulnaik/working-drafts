| 2018 || {{dts|September 21}} || Brent Dill controversy || In response to the controversy surrounding allegations of sexual harassment and other manipulative behavior by community member Brent Dill, CFAR disbands the Alumni Community Disputes Council (ACDC) because of poor decisionmaking by ACDC related to the controversy. CFAR Executive Director Timothy Telleen-Lawton contritely states: "To the extent that CFAR did not provide ACDC with sufficient resources and oversight to properly execute its larger mission, that is our fault and not the fault of the volunteer council members. We want to understand the details of what went wrong and how to do better going forward. We have only just started that process and will provide updates to the community once we have them. In the meantime, in addition to the actions above, we offer our apologies to the involved parties, and to all in our alumni network and in the broader community who needed better leadership in this situation."<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.rationality.org/resources/updates/2018/acdc|title = ACDC Update and Apology|date = September 21, 2018|accessdate = September 14, 2019|last = Telleen-Lawton|first = Timothy|publisher = Center for Applied Rationality}}</ref>

Habryka explains in the grant write-up that CFAR has a funding shortfall because of their decision not to run a fundraiser in 2018 in the wake of the Brent Dill controversy, so this $150,000 grant helps them get through the next few months without having to make major cuts.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CJJDwgyqT4gXktq6g/long-term-future-fund-april-2019-grant-decisions#CFAR___150_000_|title = CFAR ($150,000)|last = Habryka|first = Oliver|date = April 23, 2019|accessdate = September 14, 2019|publisher = Effective Altruism Forum}}</ref>

==Workshops==

I haven't found numbers for other years, but their [http://rationality.org/ home page] says 909 workshop alumni on 2017-07-12. The [http://rationality.org/workshops/faq#how-many-people-will-be-at-my-workshop workshop FAQ] says "Workshop size varies, but most are around 32 participants. Some are up to 60 participants." So that means maybe around 28 workshops have been conducted in all? It looks like older workshops only had 25 participants, so that could mean up to 36 workshops in all. And there have been at least 20 workshops, from those listed below.

==Meta information on the timeline==

===How the timeline was built===

The initial version of the timeline was written by [[User:Issa|Issa Rice]].

{{funding info}} is available.

===What the timeline is still missing===

* CFAR apparently ran a rationality dojo; any more info on this?<ref name="salamon-lower-cost-and-europe" />
* Timeline should probably mention some co-founders/early people, like Julia Galef, Andrew Critch, and Eliezer Yudkowsky
