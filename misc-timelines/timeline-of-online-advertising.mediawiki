!Description
|-
|1978–1992
|This era pre-dates the World Wide Web. Much of online advertising during this time period is done through [[wikipedia:Email|Email]], in the form of [[wikipedia:spamming|spamming]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.templetons.com/brad/spam/spam25.html|title=Reflections on the 25th Anniversary of Spam|website=www.templetons.com|access-date=2017-01-07}}</ref> Such activities have continued to this day, but became much more common after the ban against the commercial use of the internet was lifted in 1991.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.livinginternet.com/i/ii_nsfnet.htm|title=NSFNET - The Internet Launching Pad|website=www.livinginternet.com|access-date=2017-01-07}}</ref>
|-
|1993–1999
|With people now having their own websites, [[wikipedia:banner ads|banner ads]] are used as a source of income to pay for these websites and as side money. Companies like [[wikipedia:Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]], [[wikipedia:Global Network Navigator|Global Network Navigator]] (GNN), and [[wikipedia:HotWired|HotWired]] are pioneers in the business of online advertising.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.vantagelocal.com/history-of-online-display-advertising-2/|title=History of Online Display Advertising {{!}} Vantage Local|website=www.vantagelocal.com|access-date=2017-01-07}}</ref> Some of the companies that would later dominate online advertising are created, including Google and DoubleClick. Some models that originated at this time include: display advertising (specifically, banner ads), pay-per-click advertising (starting with Overture/Goto.com, in the context of search), ad exchanges (starting with OpenX), popup ads (by Ethan Zuckerman of Tripod.com), and behavioral targeting and retargeting (by DoubleClick).
|-
|2000–2002
|This period sees the burst of the tech bubble. There are few launches and acquisitions in this period. The main development during this period is Google's launch of Adwords (its search advertising tool) and the growth of Adwords along with increased Internet and search engine use.
|-
|2003–2006
|After recovery from the bursting of the tech bubble, the pace of acquisitions and new company formation increases again. During this period, companies such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!, and AOL acquire many nascent advertising companies, and new companies such as Criteo form.
|-
|2007–2010
|The period begins with Google's acquisition of DoubleClick (that would prove to be a great success) and Microsoft's acquisition of aQuantive (that would ultimately be written off). Big companies continue to buy key ad technology companies in this period. Acquisitions by Google/DoubleClick prove the most valuable, including the acquisition of AdMob and Invite Media. Yahoo! and AOL also acquire some companies, and Apple enters the game with its acquisition of Quattro.<br/>The period also sees the launch of Digiday and AdExchanger, two online publications devoted to online advertising and digital media.
|-
|2011–2013
|With the rebranding of DoubleClick's core offerings as DoubleClick For Publishers (DFP), and significant expansion in features available, DoubleClick Ad Exchange comes to dominate the ad exchange world, and DFP comes to dominate the publisher-facing side of ad serving. This puts Google in a strong position with respect to display advertising, in addition to its search stronghold.<br/>Two other players that enter advertising at a larger scale at this time are Facebook (through the use of sponsored stories) and Amazon (with the introduction of the Amazon Advertising Platform). Twitter also starts monetizing through promoted tweets.<br/> The period also sees more development of standards around real-time bidding (with OpenRTB 2.0) and norms around what advertisers can track and how they should disclose this information.
|-
|2014–2017
|Social media advertising continues to grow; Instagram, Pinterest and Snapchat are among the new players in the space.<br/> Google retains its dominant position in display advertising, but faces more pressure from both buyers and sellers to make its policies more friendly to their needs. Inefficiencies in the ad serving process lead to opportunities for innovations like header bidding. Google attempts to render these redundant by allowing for more competition in the ad serving.<br/>Verizon acquires AOL and then Yahoo!, with the former acquisition explicitly being justified as an ad tech acquisition.

|Google announces that it is removing the "last-look" advantage for Ad Exchange in exchanging bidding in dynamic allocation (EBDA). Previously, all exchanges other than the Ad Exchange would have to submit bids first, and Ad Exchange would submit the final bid. Now, Ad Exchange would submit its bid along with all the other exchanges.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://adexchanger.com/platforms/google-removes-last-look-auction-advantage/|title = Google Removes Its 'Last-Look' Auction Advantage|last = Sluis|first = Sarah|date = March 31, 2017|accessdate = April 3, 2017|publisher = AdExchanger}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://martechtoday.com/countering-header-bidding-google-drops-last-look-advantage-196889|title = Countering header bidding, Google drops its ‘last look’ advantage.

== Meta information on the timeline ==

=== How the timeline was built ===

* The first iteration of the timeline was created by [[wikipedia:User:Avigl|Avi Glozman]] on Wikipedia with payment from Vipul Naik, who also provided a list of event types and some sample events to get started with. The completion of the iteration (at the time of import into Timelines Wiki) is [https://timelines.issarice.com/index.php?title=Timeline_of_online_advertising&oldid=11704 here].
* The second iteration was worked on by Vipul Naik. The methods used in this iteration include:
** Reading through recent posts and archives of digital advertising and digital content publications like Digiday and AdExchanger to get a better qualitative sense of the sorts of topics discussed around digital advertising.
** Using web search engines with various search keywords that combine ad tech terms with history terms, along with date range selection tools in search, to get a bunch of pages that talk of the history of ad tech. Then, using the lists of companies and events obtained this way and explicitly searching with those as keywords to get more specific data on them.

=== What the timeline is still missing ===

The timeline is lacking in a few important respects:

* It does not provide a clear sense on the timeline of ''migration to digital'' for advertisers who have (or previously had) a big advertising presence. A number of lists of largest advertisers is available online.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://adage.com/article/advertising/world-s-largest-advertisers/306983/|title = What You Need to Know About the World's Largest Advertisers, from Adidas to Yili. Total for Ad Age's First Ranking of 100 Biggest Spenders: $241B|publisher = ''[[wikipedia:Advertising age|Advertising age]]''|date = December 4, 2016|accessdate = May 11, 2017|last = Johnson|first = Bradley}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.businessinsider.com/10-biggest-advertising-spenders-in-the-us-2015-7|title = These are the 10 companies that spend the most on advertising|last = O'Reilly|first = Lara|date = July 6, 2015|accessdate = May 11, 2017|publisher = ''[[wikipedia:Business Insider|Business Insider]]''}}</ref>
* It does not give enough importance to advertising ''agencies'', the intermediaries between the companies on behalf of which advertisements are made, and the DSPs or ad networks that actually manage ad pacing, bidding, and delivery. Advertising agencies are responsible for designing ad creatives and manage the relationship with the DSP (or sometimes directly with the ad network or publisher). They again pre-date the Internet, so their ''migration to digital'' (or the evolution of new digital-focused agencies) is worth understanding. Examples include [[wikipedia:Havas|Havas]] and [[wikipedia:GroupM|GroupM]].
* More coverage is needed of "brand safety" issues.
* More coverage is needed of issues related to viewability, ad fraud, and third-party measurement and verification.
* Maybe a row or two on hacks such as floor price optimization, and other evolutions in the real-time bidding space?
* More coverage of attribution and connection with offline purchases (to the extent that it strongly connects with online advertising)
