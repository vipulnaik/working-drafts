|-
| 2006 || August || Prelude || {{w|Holden Karnofsky}} and Elie Hassenfeld, working at a {{w|hedge fund}} in {{w|Connecticut}}, set up an informal “charity club” with colleagues, to help them make informed decisions about their giving. Each person would pick a cause and then research the best charities working on that cause, evaluating them based on data and {{w|performance metric}}s. Hassenfeld and Karnofsky find this work so satisfying that it would ultimately lead them to create GiveWell.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pitney|first1=Nico|title=That Time A Hedge Funder Quit His Job And Then Raised $60 Million For Charity|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/26/elie-hassenfeld-givewell_n_6927320.html|website=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=17 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=elie-where-im-coming-from>{{cite web|url = https://blog.givewell.org/2007/02/20/38/|title = Where I’m coming from|last = Hassenfeld|first = Elie|date = February 20, 2007|accessdate = August 28, 2022}}</ref>

|-
| 2006 || December 23 || Content creation || The first post on the GiveWell blog is from this date.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://blog.givewell.org/2006/12/23/nice-to-meet-you/|title = Nice to meet you|last = Karnofsky|first = Holden|date = December 23, 2006|accessdate = August 28, 2022|publisher = GiveWell}}</ref> The initial tone of the blog would be playful and exploratory, with Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld sharing the intermediate results of their investigations and using emotionally expressive language. Over time, the blog would mirror the organization's own growth in stature and influence and switch to a more formal, measured tone.
|-
| 2006 || December 28 || Cause identification (malaria) || In a post on the GiveWell blog, Karnofsky expresses excitement about the seemingly low cost-per-life-saved ($200) of malaria net distribution based on numbers provided by {{w|Nothing But Nets}} for malaria net distribution, as well as a study of the effect of malaria net distribution on malaria-induced mortality. Karnofsky does not yet have enough details to make a concrete recommendation, but seems excited about the possibility, and argues that readers too should be excited at the possibility of saving lives at such a "bargain" price.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://blog.givewell.org/2006/12/28/dont-let-elie-rip-you-off/|title = Don’t let Elie rip you off!|date = December 28, 2006|accessdate = August 28, 2022|last = Karnofsky|first = Holden|publisher = GiveWell}}</ref> GiveWell's interest in malaria nets would eventually lead to it recommending {{w|Against Malaria Foundation}} in 2010, an organization that GiveWell would recommend for the next decade, with brief pauses in due to lack of room for more funding.
|-
| 2007 || January 2 || || Holden Karnofsky blogs about his 2006 donation decisions, that are split between New Visions for Public Schools ($5000), Interplast ($2000), Children's Aid Society ($1000) and four other smaller causes ($256 each). Karnofsky argues for donating to fewer of the causes that one thinks are best rather than splitting donatons across a wide variety of causes that one does not think are all equally good; this repeats parts of an argument made previously by Steven Landsburg, though Karnosky still ends up splitting between seven charities. Karnofsky says that his decision was "based on about .01% of the information I wish I had".<ref>{{cite web|url = https://blog.givewell.org/2007/01/02/the-2006-holden-awards/|title = The 2006 Holden Awards|last = Karnofsky|first = Holden|date = January 2, 2007|accessdate = August 28, 2022|publisher = GiveWell}}</ref> The only named charity in the list that would make it to the 2007 end-of-year recommendations would be Interplast, and none of these charities would make it to the GiveWell end-of-year recommendations starting 2009.
|-
| 2007 || January 7 || Recommendation || In a blog post, Elie Hassenfeld announces GiveWell's first official recommendation: {{w|Population Services International}} (PSI) for their work on oral rehydration therapy (ORT) that helps combat diarrhea, for an estimate of $50 per life saved.<ref name=psi-first-rec>{{cite web|url = https://blog.givewell.org/2007/01/07/recommending-population-services-international/|title = Recommending Population Services International|date = January 7, 2007|accessdate = August 28, 2022|last = Hassenfeld|first = Elie|publisher = GiveWell}}</ref> PSI would also be a recommendation at the end of 2007, but would drop out of the recommendations in GiveWell's updated list at the end of 2009 and never return as a top charity.
|-
| 2007 || January, with some followup posts in March || Concept development (overhead ratio fallacy) || In a series of blog posts, Holden Karnofsky critiques the "overhead ratio" (the split of a charity's revenue that it spends on overhead versus direct program expenses) -- a prominent measure used by {{w|Charity Navigator}} to rate charities. Karnofsky says that the measure is useful to identify really wasteful charities, but that it does little to help figure out the effectiveness of a charity's programs and does not help identify the best charities.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://blog.givewell.org/2007/01/09/i-found-a-number-that-tells-you-everything-you-need-to-know/|title = I found a number that tells you everything you need to know|last = Karnofsky|first = Holden|date = January 9, 2007|accessdate = August 28, 2022|publisher = GiveWell}}</ref><ref name=before-tearing-straw-man-apart>{{cite web|url = https://blog.givewell.org/2007/01/09/before-i-tear-the-straw-man-apart/|title = Before I tear the Straw Man apart …|last = Karnofsky|first = Holden|date = January 9, 2007|accessdate = August 28, 2022|publisher = GiveWell}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://blog.givewell.org/2007/01/13/ok-straw-man-the-gloves-are-off/|title = OK, Straw Man, the gloves are off|last = Karnofsky|first = Holden|date = January 13, 2007|accessdate = August 28, 2022|publisher = GiveWell}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://blog.givewell.org/2007/01/16/which-of-these-boasts-is-not-like-the-others/|title = Which of these boasts is not like the others?|last = Karnofsky|first = Holden|date = January 16, 2007|accessdate = August 28, 2022|publisher = GiveWell}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://blog.givewell.org/2007/01/30/straw-man-or-75-of-the-population/|title = Straw man?

| 2007 || February || Update || A blog post by Elie Hassenfeld talks about the reactions of nonprofits working in the clean water space to the questions he posed to them about their work. He classifies the reactions into three categories: hostile, dumbfounded, and grateful. Hassenfeld feels that Population Services International is one of the few organizations that was able to provide an adequate response, but he'd like to do a lot better by the end of 2007.<ref name=elie-where-im-coming-from/>

| 2007 || February 16 || External citation || Writing for Tactical Philanthropy, Sean Stannard-Stockton praises the efforts of the GiveWell blog and project, calling it the "pissed off donor model" and saying: "I don’t agree with everything they write. But it is refreshing to see donors blogging instead of consultants and advisors (like me) telling everyone what donors want." He asks (rhetorically?) why foundations don't share more of their research publicly the way GiveWell has been.<ref name=givewell-vs-ford-foundation>{{cite web|url = https://www.tacticalphilanthropy.com/2007/02/givewell-vs-the-ford-foundation/|title = GiveWell vs. The Ford Foundation|date = February 16, 2007|accessdate = August 28, 2022|last = Stannard-Stockton|first = Sean|publisher = Tactical Philanthropy}}</ref>

I’m not committed to addressing malaria, or diarrhea, or education. I’m just committed to helping the world. Anyone who does that better than you can win my donation away. And they will. Most importantly, they should.}}Karnofksy's remaining points underline that he, as a donor, actually wants to know how his money will be used, and is looking to have impact and learn the truth rather than looking for "reassurance" or "customer service".

They aren't able to cover causes 3 and 4 as GiveWell hasn't done enough research in these yet. For "Employment assistance" the board unanimously chooses with HOPE after some discussion. For Cause 1, "Saving lives in Africa", the debate is between Population Services International (PSI) and Partners in Health (PIH), with heated debate ultimately leading to PSI being selected. For "Global poverty", the board goes with Opportunity International, despite overall reservations regarding the microfinance category.
