== Background ==

On July 20, 2017, the Bitcoin community voted, 97% in favor, on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 91. The proposal, by Bitmain Warranty engineer James Hilliard, was to activate Segregated Witness (SegWit) on August 1, 2017, without increasing the 1 MB block size of transactions, and maintaining backwards compatibility.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.inverse.com/article/34693-bitcoin-hard-fork-soft-fork-explained-august-1|title = When Will Bitcoin Fork, and What's It Mean for Crypto's Future?

Some member of the Bitcoin community felt that simply adopting BIP 91, without increasing the block-size limit, was simply kicking the can down the road, and that it favored people who wanted to treat Bitcoin as digital gold rather than transactional cash.<ref name=nyt-split/><ref name=qz-bitcoin-civil-war/> They implemented a fork of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, called Bitcoin Cash, that started trading on July 23. The forked cryptocurrency inherited the transaction history of the main Bitcoin currency until that point, but further transactions were separate. Bitcoin Cash is scheduled to implement an eight-fold increase in the block size limit on August 1, making it backwards-incompatible with the main Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash started out trading at 0.5 BTC on July 23, its first day of trading, but dropped to 0.2 BTC by July 25.<ref name=qz-bitcoin-civil-war/>
