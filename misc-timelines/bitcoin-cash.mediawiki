== Background ==

On July 20, 2017, the bitcoin community voted, 97% in favor, on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 91. The proposal, by Bitmain Warranty engineer James Hilliard, was to activate Segregated Witness ([[SegWit]]) on August 1, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.inverse.com/article/34693-bitcoin-hard-fork-soft-fork-explained-august-1|title = When Will Bitcoin Fork, and What's It Mean for Crypto's Future?

Some members of the bitcoin community felt that adopting BIP 91 without increasing the block-size limit would simply delay confronting the issue and that it favored people who wanted to treat bitcoin as a digital investment rather than transactional currency.<ref name=nyt-split/><ref name=qz-bitcoin-civil-war/> They intended to implement a fork of the bitcoin cryptocurrency, called Bitcoin Cash, on August 1. It inherits the transaction history of the bitcoin currency on that date, but further transactions are to be separate. Block 478558 was the last common block and thus the first Bitcoin Cash block was 478559.<ref>[https://news.bitcoin.com/fork-watch-first-bitcoin-cash-block-mined/ First Bitcoin Cash block on bitcoin.com]</ref> It implements a block size increase to 8 MB, making it backwards-incompatible with the bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin Cash started futures trading at 0.5 BTC on July 23, but dropped to 0.10 BTC by July 30. Market cap appeared since 23:15 UTC, August 1, 2017<ref name=qz-bitcoin-civil-war/><ref>[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash Bitcoin Cash (BCH)]</ref>
