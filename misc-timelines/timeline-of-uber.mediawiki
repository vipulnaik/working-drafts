{| class="wikitable sortable"
! Time period !! class="unsortable" | Key developments at Uber
|-
| 2009–2010 || Uber focuses mostly on the [[wikipedia:San Francisco Bay Area|San Francisco Bay Area]]
|-
| 2011 || Uber starts its national expansion. 
|-
| 2012–2013 || Uber starts its international expansion. 
|-
| 2014 || Uber continues its international expansion and starts offering logistic services (like courier package delivery). It changes its tagline from "Everyone's private driver" to the much broader "Where lifestyle meets logistics".
|-
| late 2014, 2015 || As Uber's recognition grows, the company starts to face increasing pressure from regulators, both in the [[wikipedia:United States|United States]] and in [[wikipedia:India|India]].
|-
| 2015 || Uber announces a major investment in [[wikipedia:autonomous car|self-driving cars]].
|-
| 2015 || Uber doubles down on its efforts to attain market dominance in [[wikipedia:India|India]] (against dominant player [[wikipedia:Ola Cabs|Ola Cabs]]), [[wikipedia:China|China]] (against [[wikipedia:Didi Kuaidi|Didi Kuaidi]], an entity formed by a merger of [[wikipedia:Didi Dache|Didi Dache]] and [[wikipedia:Kuaidi Dache|Kuaidi Dache]]), and South-East Asia (against [[wikipedia:GrabTaxi|GrabTaxi]]). In response, the dominant players raise huge sums of money to keep Uber at bay, and announce strategic partnerships of various sorts, with the most recent one being a partnership between Ola Cabs, Didi Kuaidi, GrabTaxi, and [[wikipedia:Lyft|Lyft]], the runner-up to Uber in the United States.
|-
| 2016 || Uber concedes defeat in China, and doubles down on its self-driving car work, UberEATS, and continued geographical expansion in other regions.
|-
| 2017 || This is a rocky year for Uber, as it is beset by a number of controversies (related to activities in previous years). Some controversies center around the work culture, specifically the way it handles sexual harassment. Others center around secret programs to evade government regulators (Greyball), competitor monitoring (Hell, to track Lyft drivers), and user fingerprinting in the app combined with geo-fencing to evade detection (leading to a conflict with Apple). Uber subsidiary Otto also faces accusations of intellectual property theft from Waymo, formerly the Google self-driving car project.<br/>The controversies lead to a series of high-profile departures from Uber, culminating in the resignation of CEO Travis Kalanick. New CEO Dara Khosrowshahi takes a more measured, fiscally prudent approach and targets an IPO in the next 18 to 36 months.
