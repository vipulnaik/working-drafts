|-
| 1997–2006|| Netflix is founded on a mail-rental DVD service, goes IPO, and faces vicious competition with Blockbuster.
|-
|2007–2015 || Netflix starts its online subscription service in 2007 (a year after just over 50% of American households have broadband access), and online streaming ultimately forms the basis of Netflix's business model (as usage of DVDs starts declining). Netflix starts internationalization in 2010, reaches over 26 million subscribers worldwide by April 2011, 40.4 million subscribers by September 2013, and 81 million by April 2016. By 2015, it starts accounting for over one-third of all US Internet traffic.<ref name="MyUser_Time.com_May_22_2016c">{{cite web |url=http://time.com/3901378/netflix-internet-traffic/ |title=Netflix Accounts for More Than One-Third of Internet Traffic |newspaper=Time.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= May 22, 2016}}</ref> As Blockbuster declines, Netflix's primary competition is with other [[wikipedia:online streaming|online streaming]] services like [[wikipedia:Amazon Video|Amazon Video]] and [[wikipedia:Hulu|Hulu]] in the US.
