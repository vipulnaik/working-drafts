===Overall summary===

{| class="wikitable"
! Time period !! Development summary !! More details
|-
| Until 1950 || Fictional portrayals only || Most discussion of AI safety is in the form of fictional portrayals. It warns of the risks of robots who, through either stupidity or lack of goal alignment, no longer remain under the control of humans.
|-
| 1950 to 2000 || Scientific speculation + fictional portrayals || During this period, discussion of AI safety moves from merely being a topic of fiction to one that scientists who study technological trends start talking about. The era sees commentary by I. J. Good, Vernor Vinge, and Bill Joy.
|-
| 2000 to 2012 || Birth of AI safety organizations, close connections with transhumanism || This period sees the creation of the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (SIAI) (which would later become the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI)) and the evolution of its mission from creating friendly AI to reducing the risk of unfriendly AI. The Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) and Global Catastrophic Risk Institute (GCRI) are also founded. AI safety work during this time is closely tied to transhumanism and has close connections with techno-utopianism. Peter Thiel and Jaan Tallinn are key funders of the early ecosystem.
|-
| 2013 to present || Mainstreaming of AI safety, separation from transhumanism || SIAI changes name to MIRI, sells off the "Singularity" brand to Singularity University, grows considerably in size, and gets a lot of funding. ''Superintelligence'', the book  by Nick Bostrom, is released. The Future of Life Institute (FLI) and OpenAI are started, and the latter grows considerably. New organizations founded include the Center for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER), Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence (CFI), Future of Life Institute (FLI), OpenAI, Center for Human-Compatible AI (CHAI), Berkeley Existential Risk Initiative (BERI), Ought, and the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET). OpenAI in particular becomes quite famous and influential. Prominent individuals such as Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and Bill Gates talk about the importance of AI safety and the risks of unfriendly AI. Key funders of this ecosystem include Open Philanthropy and Elon Musk.

===Highlights by year (2013 onward)===

{| class="wikitable"
! Year !! Highlights
|-
| 2013 || Research and outreach focused on forecasting and timelines continue. Connections with the nascent effective altruism movement strengthen. The Center for the Study of Existential Risk and the Foundational Research Institute launch.
|-
| 2014 || ''{{w|Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies}}'' by Nick Bostrom is published. The {{w|Future of Life Institute}} is founded and AI Impacts launches. AI safety gets more mainstream attention, including from {{w|Elon Musk}}, {{w|Stephen Hawking}}, and the fictional portrayal ''{{w|Ex Machina}}''. While forecasting and timelines remain a focus of AI safety efforts, the effort shifts toward the technical AI safety agenda, with the launch of the Intelligent Agent Foundations Forum.
|-
| 2015 || AI safety continues to get more mainstream, with the founding of {{w|OpenAI}} (supported by Elon Musk and {{w|Sam Altman}}) and the {{w|Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence}}, the {{w|Open Letter on Artificial Intelligence}}, the Puerto Rico conference, and coverage on {{w|Wait But Why}}. This also appears to be the last year that Peter Thiel donates in the area.
|-
| 2016 || Open Philanthropy makes AI safety a focus area; it would ramp up giving in the area considerably starting around this time. The landmark paper "Concrete Problems in AI Safety" is published, and OpenAI's safety work picks up pace. The Center for Human-Compatible AI launches. The annual tradition of LessWrong posts providing an AI alignment literature review and charity comparison for the year begins. AI safety continues to get more mainstream, with the {{w|Partnership on AI}} and the Obama administration's efforts to understand the subject.
|-
| 2017 || This is a great year for cryptocurrency prices, causing a number of donations to MIRI from people who got rich through cryptocurrency. The AI safety funding and support landscape changes somewhat with the launch of the Berkeley Existential Risk Initiative (BERI) (and funding of its grants program by Jaan Tallinn) and the Effective Altruism Funds, specifically the Long-Term Future Fund. Open Philanthropy makes several grants in AI safety, including a $30 million grant to OpenAI and a $3.75 million grant to MIRI. AI safety attracts dismissive commentary from Mark Zuckerberg, while Elon Musk continues to highlight its importance. The year begins with the Asilomar Conference and the Asilomar AI Principles, and initiatives such as AI Watch and the AI Alignment Prize begin toward the end of the year.
|-
| 2018 || Activity in the field of AI safety becomes more steady, in terms of both ongoing discussion (with the launch of the AI Alignment Newsletter, AI Alignment Podcast, and Alignment Forum) and funding (with structural changes to the Long-Term Future Fund to make it grant more regularly, the introduction of the annual Open Philanthropy AI Fellowship grants, and more grantmaking by BERI). Near the end of the year, MIRI announces its nondisclosure-by-default policy. Ought, Median Group, and the Stanford Center for AI Safety launch during the year.
|-
| 2019 || The Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET), that is focused on AI safety and other security risks, launches with a 5-year $55 million grant from Open Philanthropy. The Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) launches. Grantmaking from the Long-Term Future Fund picks up pace; BERI hands off its grantmaking of Jaan Tallinn's money to the Survival and Flourishing Fund (SFF). Open Philanthropy begins using the Committee for Effective Altruism Support to decide grant amounts for some of its AI safety grants, including grants to MIRI. OpenAI unveils its GPT-2 model but does not release the full model initially; this sparks discussion on disclosure norms.
|-
| 2020 || Andrew Critch and David Krueger release their ARCHES paper. OpenAI unveils GPT-3, leading to further discussion of AI safety implications. AI Safety Support launches. The funding ecosystem continues to mature: Open Philanthropy and the Survival and Flourishing Fund continue to make large grants to established organizations, while the Long-Term Future Fund increasingly shifts focus to donating to individuals.
|-
| 2021 || Several new AI safety organizations start, including: Anthropic (by Dario and Daniela Amodei, along with several others who left OpenAI in late 2020 or early 2021), Alignment Research Center (by Paul Christiano, who also left OpenAI around that time), and Redwood Research (which appears to have started in 2019, but taken off and scaled up in 2021). A bunch of conversations related to AI safety, many of them including Eliezer Yudkowsky and other researchers (MIRI and non-MIRI), are published in late 2021. Jaan Tallinn's grantmaking, mostly via the Survival and Flourishing Fund, and a lot of it for AI safety, increases a lot in 2021, to $15-20 million, mostly related to the significant increase in Ethereum prices combined with his 2020 pledge.<ref name=jaan-pledge/>
|-
| 2022 || This year sees the entry of the FTX Future Fund into the AI safety funding space. Anthropic continues to grow by raising a massive Series B.

===Inclusion criteria===

Here is a partial list of thoughts on what rows we've included:

* For AI safety organizations, we have tried to include a row for their launch where available. When an exact launch date is not available, we have tried to include an approximate launch date based on the history of the website or other public announcements.
* Most grants from Open Philanthropy in AI safety are included. Some grants may be omitted because of small size. For recent grants, we may not have added them yet.
* We have tried to include important fictional portrayals and scientific speculation related to AI before 2000, as comprehensively as possible. For the period from 2000 onward, we have been more selective, and focused more on relatively notable commentary or commentary that played a role in changing the AI safety conversation in specific communities.

|-
| 1630–1650 || || Fictional portrayal || The publication of the story of the Golem of Chełm dates to around this period. [[w:Golem#Hubris theme|Wikipedia]]: "Golems are not intelligent, and if commanded to perform a task, they will perform the instructions literally. In many depictions Golems are inherently perfectly obedient. In its earliest known modern form, the Golem of Chełm became enormous and uncooperative. In one version of this story, the rabbi had to resort to trickery to deactivate it, whereupon it crumbled upon its creator and crushed him."
|-
| 1818 || || Fictional portrayal || The novel ''{{w|Frankenstein}}'' is published. ''Frankenstein'' pioneers the archetype of the artificial intelligence that turns against its creator, and is sometimes discussed in the context of an AI takeoff.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retirementsingularity.com/seven-ways-frankenstein-relates-to-singularity/ |title=Seven Ways Frankenstein Relates to Singularity |author=Michael Nuschke |publisher=RetirementSingularity.com |date=October 10, 2011 |accessdate=July 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mitchellhowe.com/QAIntellectualHistory.html |title=What is the intellectual history of the Singularity concept? |author=Mitchell Howe |year=2002 |accessdate=July 27, 2017 |quote=Bearing little resemblance to the campy motion pictures he would inspire, Dr. Frankenstein's monster was a highly intelligent being of great emotional depth, but who could not be loved because of his hideous appearance; for this, he vowed to take revenge on his creator.

|-
| 1948 || || Publication || In ''The general and logical theory of automata'', {{w|John von Neumann}} articulates the idea of self-improving AI. Notable quote: "There is, however, a certain minimum level where this degenerative characteristic ceases to be universal. At this point automata which can reproduce themselves, or even construct higher entities, become possible."<ref name=luke-early-ai-safety-timeline/> He would expand on this idea further in 1949, coming close to articulating what is now called an "intelligence explosion."<ref name=luke-early-ai-safety-timeline/>
|-
| 1950 || || Publication || {{w|Alan Turing}} publishes ''Computing Machinery and Intelligence'' in the philosophy journal ''Mind''. The paper introduces the concept of the {{w|Turing test}}, the simple idea of which is that a machine would be said to have achieved human-level intelligence if it can convince a human that it is human. The Turing test would become a key part of discussions around benchmarking artificial intelligence, and also enter popular culture over the next few decades.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.mind.ilstu.edu/curriculum/turing_machines/turing_test_and_machine_intelligence.php|title = Turing Test and Machine Intelligence|last = Bradley|first = Peter|publisher = Consortium on Computer Science Instruction}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://intelligence.org/2013/08/11/what-is-agi/|title = What is AGI?|last = Muehlhauser|first = Luke|date = August 11, 2013|accessdate = September 8, 2019|publisher = Machine Intelligence Research Institute}}</ref>

|-
| 1966 || || Fictional portrayal || The science fiction novel ''[[w:Colossus (novel)|Colossus]]'' by British author {{w|Dennis Feltham Jones}} is published. In the novel, both the United States and the USSR develop supercomputers, called Colossus and Guardian respectively, that they connect with each other to share knowledge. The supercomputers coordinate with each other to become increasingly powerful, and humans belatedly try to regain control.<ref name=luke-early-ai-safety-timeline/>
|-
| 1966 || || Publication || In ''Other Worlds than Ours'', Cecil Maxwell argues that nations would invest in building powerful intelligent machines and surrender decisionmaking to them, and any nation that succeeded would grow into a major world power. He writes: ''It seems that, in the forseeable future, the major nations of the world will have to face the alternative of surrendering national control to mechanical ministers, or being dominated by other nations which have already done this. Such a process will eventually lead to the domination of the whole Earth by a dictatorship of an unparalleled type — a single supreme central authority.''<ref name=luke-early-ai-safety-timeline/>
|-
| 1974 || || Publication || In ''The Ignorance Explosion'', Julius Lukasiewicz argues that it is very hard to predict the future after we have machine superintelligence.<ref name=luke-early-ai-safety-timeline/>
|-
| 1977 || || Fictional portrayal || The science fiction novel ''{{w|The Adolescence of P-1}}'' by Thomas Joseph Ryan is published. It "tells the story of an intelligent worm that at first is merely able to learn to hack novel computer systems and use them to propagate itself, but later (1) has novel insights on how to improve its own intelligence, (2) develops convergent instrumental subgoals for self-preservation and resource acquisition, and (3) learns the ability to fake its own death so that it can grow its powers in secret and later engage in a "treacherous turn"against humans."<ref name=luke-early-ai-safety-timeline/>
|-
| 1979 || || Publication || In the book ''Machines Who Think'' by {{w|Pamela McCorduck}}, {{w|Edward Fredkin}} descibes the challenge of controlling smarter-than-human artificial general intelligences. He describes the high communication bandwidth betweeen superintelligent machines, the goal-directed nature of intelligent systems, and the challenge of aligning the goals of the machines with those of humans.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vFbeACxRb4YptwtwK/open-thread-july-1-15-2013?commentId=NWJxn2RgnLMJzMXPQ|title = Miles Brundage recently pointed me to these quotes from Ed Fredkin, recorded in McCorduck (1979).|last = Muehlhauser|first = Luke|date = July 12, 2013|accessdate = May 7, 2020|publisher = LessWrong}}</ref>
|-
| 1984 || {{dts|October 26}} || Fictional portrayal || The American science fiction film ''{{w|The Terminator}}'' is released. The film contains the first appearance of [[w:Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]], a "neural net-based conscious group mind and artificial general intelligence" that "seeks to exterminate the human race in order to fulfill the mandates of its original coding".
|-
| 1985 || || Fictional portrayal || In ''{{w|Robots and Empire}}'', Isaac Asimov introduces the Zeroth Law of Robotics, which states: "A robot may not injure humanity, or through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm." This is analogous to, and must take precedence over, the Fist Law "A robot may not injure a human being, or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm." The law was self-programmed by the robot {{w|R. Daneel Olivaw}} based on the ideas of {{w|R. Giskard Reventlov}}. In particular, the zeroth law now allows a robot to harm or allow harm to individual humans for the greater good of humanity.
|-
| 1987 || || Publication || In an article ''A Question of Responsibility'' for AI Magazine, Mitchell Waldrop introduces the term {{w|machine ethics}}. He writes: ''However, one thing that is apparent from the above discussion is that intelligent machines will embody values, assumptions, and purposes, whether their programmers consciously intend them to or not. Thus, as computers and robots become more and more intelligent, it becomes imperative that we think carefully and explicitly about what those built-in values are. Perhaps what we need is, in fact, a theory and practice of machine ethics, in the spirit of Asimov’s three laws of robotics.''<ref name="Waldrop1987">{{cite journal |last1=Waldrop |first1=Mitchell |title=A Question of Responsibility |journal=AI Magazine |date=Spring 1987 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=28–39 |doi=10.1609/aimag.v8i1.572}}</ref>
|-
| 1988 || {{dts|October 1}} || Publication || The book ''Mind Children: The Future of Robot and Human Intelligence'' by {{w|Hans Moravec}} is published. The book says that machines with human-level intelligenece are feasible within fifty years, and should be thought of as the "mind children" of humans. The book would be listed in a 2013 MIRI blog post in a list of past work on AI safety and the AI takeoff.<ref name=miri-posner/>

|-
| 1998 || {{dts|December 3}} || Publication || The book ''Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind'' by {{w|Hans Moravec}} is published. The book argues that human levels of intelligence are achievable by 2040, and has an optimistic take on this future: "Intelligent machines, which will grow from us, learn our skills, and share our goals and values, can be viewed as children of our minds." It continues the themes of Moravec's previous book ''Mind Children'', and would be cited in a 2013 MIRI blog post in a list of past work related to AI safety and the AI takeoff.<ref name=miri-posner/>

[...] Still, much of Posner’s analysis is consistent with the basic points of the Bostrom-Yudkowsky tradition [...] One major point of divergence seems to be that Posner worries about a scenario in which AGIs become self-aware, re-evaluate their goals, and decide not to be “bossed around by a dumber species” anymore."<ref name=miri-posner>{{cite web|url = https://intelligence.org/2013/10/18/richard-posner-on-ai-dangers/|title = Richard Posner on AI Dangers|last = Muehlhauser|first = Luke|date = October 18, 2013|accessdate = May 7, 2020|publisher = Machine Intelligence Resarch}}</ref>

==Meta information on the timeline==

===How the timeline was built===

The initial version of the timeline was written by [[User:Issa|Issa Rice]]. The timeline was later expanded considerably by [[User:Vipul|Vipul Naik]]. [[User:Sebastian|Sebastian Sanchez]] also added graphs to the timeline.

Issa likes to work locally and track changes with Git, so the revision history on this wiki only shows changes in bulk. To see more incremental changes, refer to the commit histories at the [https://github.com/riceissa/issarice.com/commits/master/external/timelines.issarice.com/Timeline_of_friendly_artificial_intelligence.mediawiki old location] and the [https://github.com/riceissa/issarice.com/commits/master/external/timelines.issarice.com/Timeline_of_AI_safety.mediawiki new location].

{{funding info}} is available.

===What the timeline is still missing===

* I think some of Abram Demski's work (radical probabilism?) should be included, but I don't know enough to decide which things are most important. I think similar things can be said for other technical researchers too.

* maybe more from [https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sm6npdgZArSn4afeZ/ai-researchers-on-ai-risk AI Researchers On AI Risk] but no dates; use as starting point to know what people to look for

* the name change from "friendly AI" to "AI safety" and "AI alignment" is probably worth adding, though this was gradual so kind of hard to pin down as an event. See also [https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cuB3GApHqLFXG36C6/i-am-nate-soares-ama#AGZGEwsQ6QWda8Xnt this comment].
