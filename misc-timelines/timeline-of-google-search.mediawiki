This is a followup to a broad core update done in July; these two were originally meant to be a single update. SEO commentators note that the update propagated quickly with the effects beginning to be seen shortly after Google's announcement of the rollout, in contrast with the June update that started a little later and had a longer period of increased volatility.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://twitter.com/searchliaison/status/1410629484911349761|title = The July 2021 Core Update, previously announced, is now rolling out|date = July 1, 2021|accessdate = July 7, 2021|publisher = Google Search Liaison}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://searchengineland.com/googles-july-2021-core-update-rolled-out-quickly-here-is-what-the-data-providers-saw-350243|title = Google’s July 2021 core update rolled out quickly; here is what the data providers saw.
