| 2000 || June || Partnership || || || {{w|Yahoo!}} switches its search engine from {{w|Inktomi}} to {{w|Google Search}}. An article on the switch in ''{{w|The Guardian}}'' says that the likely reasons are Google's technical superiority, larger and more comprehensive index, and its not taking money to boost search rankings.

|-
| 2001 || January 2 || Web ecosystem || || || {{w|Wikipedia}} (specifically, English Wikipedia) launches as a side project of Nupedia and starts growing rapidly. Wikipedia would eventually launch in hundreds of languages and become the most widely used reference website on the Internet. Wikipedia results generally meet at least a minimum of quality standards and are not spam, and starting around the late 2000s, Google would often rank Wikipedia highly in many kinds of search results, thereby guaranteeing that it was offering at least one search result that was not spam and of at least moderately high quality. However, over time, as the web would expand to become home to a wider range of reference websites, Google's reliance on Wikipedia would reduce.

|-
| 2001 || September 11 || || || || The {{w|September 11 attacks}} take place, with two planes flying into the Twin Towers in New York City. At this time, Google's index is updated monthly, so it does not pick up information about the attacks, so users searching for information about the Twin Towers are shown outdated search results about the Twin Towers rather than about the recent developments. Google addresses this by manually adding links to news websites that are covering recent developments. This leads Google to start focusing on more frequent crawling and indexing. It is also the impetus for Google engineer {{w|Krishna Bharat}} to get the idea for, and lead the development of, {{w|Google News}}.<ref name=evolution-of-search-video/><ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.teknicks.com/blog/how-9-11-changed-google-forever/|title = How 9/11 Changed Google Forever|last = Bahto|first = Alyssa|publisher = teknicks|date = September 11, 2013|accessdate = November 30, 2024}}</ref>

| 2003 || February || Search algorithm update || Indexing, ranking || || Google announces the ''Boston'' update at SES Boston. This is the oldest of Google's named search algorithm updates. Boston begins a trend of monthly updates that affect both indexing and ranking, with each update causing significant changes in search ranking (compared to very little change at other times), with SEOs watching closely, a phenomenon that would be dubbed the Google Dance. This would continue until the Fritz update in July 2003.<ref name=moz/>

| 2003 || July || Search algorithm update || Indexing || || Google announces the ''Fritz'' update, and also a change to its update policy, as it moves towards continuous rather than batch processing of updates to its index.

| 2008 || September 2 || Parent company update, complementary product || Browser || || Google releases {{w|Google Chrome}} in beta for Windows (XP and newer). This marks Google's entry into the web browser space. Chrome would eventually get to a market share of over 50% and become the default browser on most Android phones. The relationship of Chrome with Google Search would be multi-fold. First, right from the outset, Google uses an "omnibox" where the address bar serves the dual purpose of being a search bar, so that people can type in either urls or search queries, with the search queries being run using the user's selected search engine (with Google Search being the default selection). Second, and in the reverse direction, information that Google collects from Chrome, suitably anonymized, gives Google a better picture of websites and users' web browsing patterns, which informs its search strategy. For instance, starting in 2021, Google uses core web vitals data collected anonymously through Chrome as part of its page experience signal that is a ranking signal.<ref name=page-experience-rollout-twitter/>

The default browser on most Android devices would be Chrome and the default search engine would be Google Search, and the collection of Google apps would come preinstalled on most Android phones, helping cement Google's influence on mobile phone use, which would grow over time.

The testimony goes over various subsystems of Google's core systems (these are the subsystems that get updated as part of "core updates"). The testimony calls Navboost (Google's click feedback signal that keeps track of what search result the user clicks on and whether they navigate back quickly) one of Google's strongest ranking signals and mentions it 54 times. The testimony also reveals that Navboost click data is now preserved for 13 months (it used to be 18 months back in 2017). Glue is described as the equivalent of Navboost for results other than web results. Tangram is described as the equivalent system for other search features. RankBrain is described as the algorithm used to finally rank within the top 20 to 30 results, as it is expensive to run on a much larger dataset; it is also trained on click and query data. RankEmbed BERT and DeepRank complement and support RankBrain. The testimony also covers Information Satisfaction (IS) scores and the use of interleaving for A/B testing (where results from different algorithms are interleaved together in the same set of search results).<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.blindfiveyearold.com/what-pandu-nayak-taught-me-about-seo|title =  What Pandu Nayak Taught Me About SEO|last = Kohn|first = AJ|date = November 16, 2023|accessdate = December 1, 2024}}</ref> The testimony as well as Kohn's analysis are linked and discussed further in Search Engine Land, with focus on slightly different parts.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://searchengineland.com/how-google-search-ranking-works-pandu-nayak-435395|title = How Google Search and ranking works, according to Google’s Pandu Nayak.

== List of search updates made in later years ==

Some of these search updates would clutter the full timeline, and many of them have specialized pieces of information that are brought out more effectively in a more customized table structure. We cover these search updates in this section.

=== Core updates starting 2019 ===

Google uses the shorthand "core updates" for what it describes as broad updates to its search algorithms, that are not targeted at a specific use case but change the core systems used within search. For such updates, Google says that websites have nothing in particular to "fix" and should just work on general best practices and creating great content.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://x.com/searchliaison/status/1050447185177800704|title = Sometimes, we make broad changes to our core algorithm. We inform about those because the actionable advice is that there is nothing in particular to “fix,” and we don’t want content owners to mistakenly try to change things that aren’t issues….|date = October 11, 2018|accessdate = November 24, 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2019/08/core-updates|title = What site owners should know about Google's August 2019 core update|date = August 1, 2019|accessdate = November 24, 2024|publisher = Google Search Central}}</ref>

A few notes:

* Starting 2019, Google has pushed the naming convention where an update is named based on the month and year it started rolling out. For instance, the update that rolled out from June 3, 2019 to June 8, 2019 is the June 2019 core update. The update that rolled out from May 25, 2022 to June 9, 2022 is termed the May 2022 core update based on the month when it started rolling out. The SEO community has adopted this convention. This convention also makes sense in light of the fact (discussed in a later bullet point) that Google doesn't reveal any other details of the core update, so it's hard to give a more semantically meaningful name.
* Google has been getting better over time in terms of communicating core updates.
** Historically, Google would often either fail to confirm core updates or confirm then only after the fact.
** Starting in 2019, Google has been more proactive about announcing core updates, initially via the Search Liaison Twitter handle (@searcliaison) once the update starts (and sometimes even prior to it). The account used for later announcements was the Google Search Central Twitter handle (@googlesearchc). By 2022, the announcement of core updates was now happening on the Google Search Central blog, with an update to the blog post indicating the completion of the rollout.
** By 2021, Google was also usually announcing the end of rollout of each core update, generally through a reply message to the Twitter (now X) message where it had announced the original rollout.
** By September 2022, Google had made available a search status history page that covers all officially announced Google algorithm updates, including all core updates, going back to January 2020. This includes the start date and duration of each update.<ref name=google-search-status-history>{{cite web|url = https://status.search.google.com/products/rGHU1u87FJnkP6W2GwMi/history|title = Google Search Status Dashboard > Incidents > Ranking|accessdate = November 24, 2024}}</ref>
** Starting 2023, Google has been providing the duration of updates at a granularity of hours, for instance "13 days, 7 hours" reflecting the fact that the Google Search Status dashboard is now updated close to real-time to reflect the status of search updates.
* Google rarely reveals details of the kinds of changes made in its core updates, which is consistent with Google's view that websites have nothing to "fix" in response to these updates. Google does not even provide insight into how big an update is, how it relates to previous updates, and what parts of the rollout period are expected to see the most flux.
** However, Google has confirmed one important tidbit: that it has multiple core systems, and that different core updates may touch on different core systems. For instance, Google revealed that its October 2023 and November 2023 core updates were for different core systems.<ref name=google-core-updates-q-and-a>{{cite web|url = https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/11/q-and-a-on-search-updates|title = A Q&A on Google Search updates|date = November 2, 2023|accessdate = November 24, 2024|publisher = Google Search Central Blog}}</ref>
* A note on the duration calculation and its relationship to start and end dates: generally, based on the timing of announcement, it seems that Google starts and ends its updates during US daytime hours (generally working hours or close). Therefore, the difference between the end and start date is a rough estimate of the duration in days. Had the updates started early in the morning and ended late at night, the duration could be rounded to one more than the difference of dates, and if it were the other way around, the duration could be rounded to one less. Fortunately, the narrow time-of-day range means that the duration is relatively easy to interpret.
* While there is a lot of variation from update to update, the general trend has been for core updates to get bigger in terms of the overall flux they create, and also for them to have a longer rollout period (this can be seen by how the "Duration in days" column is generally increasing as we go down the table). The longer rollout period means that core updates can have much greater overall flux while still having comparable peak volatility.
* In the absence of clear guidance from Google, SEO commentators and data providers collect and publish their own data. For each core update, Search Engine Land generally does a roundup post collating what different data providers are expected. Data providers often draw different conclusions as the use different methologies and have different sets of search queries and domains that they monitor. However, aggregating the information from data providers as well as SEO chatter generally provides a decent picture of (a) when in the rollout period the flux in results was greatest, (b) roughly how this update compares in magnitude to other updates. In some cases, there are also insights into what categories are most affected, or what kinds of domains have gained or lost traction. For instance, some updates tend to help reference websites, while others tend to hurt reference websites.

Overall, SEOs and data providers agree that the combined effect of the core update and the spam update is massive, particularly in terms of eliminating a bunch of sites completely (specifically, sites Google deems as spam, AI-generated, error-prone, and overly focused on search engines rather than humans), and massively switching around the rankings in the bottom half of the SERPs.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://searchengineland.com/google-march-2024-core-update-key-observations-440148|title = 3 key observations about the Google March 2024 core update.

This could include sites created primarily to match very specific search queries."
