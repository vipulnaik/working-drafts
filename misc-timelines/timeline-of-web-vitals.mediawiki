This is a timeline of web vitals, a set of metrics championed by Google that relate to how well web pages load. Of particular interest are three metrics Google calls '''core web vitals''', whose values in field data are used to inform a "page experience" score that affects search ranking on mobile devices.

== List of web vitals and corresponding aspects of performance ==

Note that for the three web vitals measured in both field and Lab data, the thresholds for good and poor for field data match the thresholds for good and poor on Lab data (measured using Lighthouse) respectively. This has been the case since June 2021 updates to field data thresholds and the corresponding release of Lighthouse v8. The desktop Lab data thresholds differ for some web vitals, and are not in the table below to keep it simple.
