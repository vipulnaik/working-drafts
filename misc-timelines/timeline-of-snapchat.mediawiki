! Time period !! Development summary !! More details 
|-
| April 2011{{snd}}December 2012 || Conception and initial launch || Snapchat is conceived of by Stanford graduate students. Initial versions are launched and an initial userbase is obtained.
|-
| December 2012{{snd}}November 2014 || Product build-out, userbase acquisition, funding || Snapchat raises funds in three rounds (Series A: $13.5 million, Series B: $80 million, and Series C: $50 million). The userbase grows significantly, with the number of daily snaps sent growing to 400 million by November 2013. Key features are added to the product, including video sharing, Snapchat Stories, and ephemeral text messaging. Some initial announcements are made regarding monetization.
|-
| December 2014{{snd}}August 2016 || Aggressive fundraising, focus on video, more product iterations || Snapchat raises large funding rounds (Series D: $485 million, Series E: at least $200 million but possibly up to $500 million, and Series F: $1.8 billion). Since Snapchat raises money more continuously, it is hard to pinpoint a specific funding round, creating some confusion for reporting. With the additional funds, Snapchat aggressively improves the product, with changes such as Chat 2.0, the introduction of stickers, and new monetization strategies. Daily video views grow from 2 billion in May 2015 to 6 billion in November 2015 and 10 billion in April 2016. Note, however, that unlike Facebook, that counts a view only after at least three seconds on it (and YouTube, which follows a more restrictive definition), Snapchat counts a view as soon as the video start playing, making its numbers hard to compare with Facebook.<ref name=bloomberg-10-billion>{{cite web|url = http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-28/snapchat-user-content-fuels-jump-to-10-billion-daily-video-views|title = Snapchat User `Stories' Fuel 10 Billion Daily Video Views|last = Frier|first = Sarah|date = April 28, 2016|accessdate = August 13, 2016|publisher = ''[[wikipedia:Bloomberg News|Bloomberg News]]''}}</ref>

| 2016 || July 6 || Product || Snapchat announces Memories, a feature that helps people find older content they have posted. By default, any snaps saved to the Camera Roll also get included in Memories, though the setting can be changed. It is also possible to search through old snaps in Memories. Memories itself cannot be accessed by others, but snaps collected from memories can be used as part of Snapchat Stories, that others ''can'' see temporarily. This also makes it easy for people to recover their snaps if their device is lost or damaged. Particularly sensitive content can be saved under My Eyes Only with passcode protection, but the content cannot be retrieved if the passcode is lost.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/06/snapchat-memories/|title = Snapchat Memories is a searchable replacement for your camera roll|last = Constine|first = Josh|date = July 6, 2016|accessdate = August 13, 2016|publisher = ''[[wikipedia:TechCrunch|TechCrunch]]''}}</ref>
