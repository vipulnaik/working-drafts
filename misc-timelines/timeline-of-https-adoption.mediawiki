|-
| 1994 || || Browser || Netspace Navigator || Protocol support || {{w|Netscape Communications}} creates HTTPS for its {{w|Netscape Navigator}} web browser, originally for use with the {{w|Secure Sockets Layer}} (SSL) protocol.
|-
| 2000 || {{dts|May}} || Standard || RFC 2818 || || RFC 2818 of the {{w|Internet Engineering Task Force}} describes the standard for HTTPS, using HTTP over {{w|Transport Layer Security}} (TLS). This is considered a superior, more secure form of HTTPS than HTTPS over SSL.
|-
| 2008 || {{dts|July 24}} || Website || Google (GMail) || Opt-in HTTPS-only || Google adds a setting in GMail for users to always use HTTPS. Even before this, users could (since the inception of GMail) access it securely by explicitly typing https:// in the browser. With the new setting, users who have opted in to it will be redirected from HTTP to HTTPS.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://gmail.googleblog.com/2008/07/making-security-easier.html|title = Making security easier|date = July 24, 2008|accessdate = November 19, 2017|last = Rideout|first = Ariel|publisher = Google}}</ref>
|-
| 2010 || {{dts|January 12}} || Website || Google (GMail) || Default HTTPS-only || Google switches all GMail users to redirect to HTTPS; users can change their setings to not redirect to HTTPS. Previously, the default option for this setting was to not redirect, and users had to explicitly choose the option to redirect HTTP to HTTPS.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://gmail.googleblog.com/2010/01/default-https-access-for-gmail.html|title = Default https access for Gmail|date = January 12, 2010|accessdate = November 19, 2017|publisher = Google|last = Schillace|first = Sam}}</ref>
|-

|-
| 2010 || {{dts|October 14}} || Proxy/load balancer || AWS Elastic Load Balancing || || AWS Elastic Load Balancing announces support for SSL termination. This means that websites hosted on AWS, behind AWS load balancers, can upload their certificates to the load balancer, and have the load balancer take care of the SSL certificate, so that the servers that receive the actual traffic only have to handle HTTP traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/elastic-load-balancer-support-for-ssl-termination/|title = AWS Elastic Load Balancing: Support for SSL Termination|date = October 14, 2010|accessdate = November 19, 2017|publisher = Amazon Web Services|last = Barr|first = Jeff}}</ref>
