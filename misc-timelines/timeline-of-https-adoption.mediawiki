| 1994 || || Browser || Netspace Navigator || Protocol support || {{w|Netscape Communications}} created HTTPS in 1994 for its {{w|Netscape Navigator}} web browser, originally for use with the {{w|Secure Sockets Layer}} (SSL) protocol.
|-
| 2000 || {{dts|May}} || Standard || RFC 2818 || || RFC 2818 of the {{w|Internet Engineering Task Force}} describes the standard for HTTPS, using HTTP over {{|Transport Layer Security}} (TLS). This is considered a superior, more secure form of HTTPS than HTTPS over SSL.
|-
| 2008 || {{dts|July 24}} || Website || Google (GMail) || Opt-in HTTPS-only || Google adds a setting in GMail for users to always use HTTPS. Even before this, users could (since the inception of GMail) access it securely by explicitly typing https:// in the browser. With the new setting, users who have opted in to it will be redirected from HTTP to HTTPS.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://gmail.googleblog.com/2008/07/making-security-easier.html|title = Making security easier|date = July 24, 2008|accessdate = November 19, 2017|last = Rideout|first = Ariel|publisher = Google}}</ref>
|-
| 2010 || {{dts|January 12}} || Website || Google (GMail) || Default HTTPS-only || Google switches all GMail users to redirect to HTTPS; users can change their setings to not redirect to HTTPS.
