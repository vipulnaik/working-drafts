This is a '''timeline of brain preservation'''.

Brain preservation is the attempt to preserve a human or non-human animal with the hope that partial or complete resuscitation may be possible in the future.

{{W|Cryonics}} is the most popular method of brain preservation, and preserves individuals using low-temperature. But other methods are being used and developed as well, notably [http://www.oregoncryo.com/manual/chemicalFixation.html fixation], and a combination of both called [http://www.brainpreservation.org/21cm-aldehyde-stabilized-cryopreservation-eval-page/ aldehyde-stabilized cryopreservation].

Alternative names for brain preservation include biostasis and neural archiving.

Often confused with cryonics, suspended animation (or anabiosis) is a distinct practice where a patient body would remain biologically intact, and could be reanimated without the need to deeply repair the brain, or transfer its information to another substrate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oregoncryo.com/suspendedAnimation.html|title=Oregon Cryonics - Suspended Animation|website=www.oregoncryo.com|access-date=2019-01-24}}</ref> However, improvements in suspended animation would also improve the quality of cryopreservations given a patient could be maintained alive at lower temperature before undergoing the damaging cryonics procedure. So this timeline also includes some important milestones with regards to suspended animation.

==== Patients ====
The first people to start advocating for cryonics emerged in 1962, and the first preservation happened 4 years later. From 1966 until 1973, of the 17 attempts at freezing, only one person remained cryopreserved<ref name="SuspensionFailures"/> (hence the bumps at the beginning of the curve in the graph below). Consequently, the "pay-as-you-go" funding model was abandoned by the cryonics community as relatives had shown to generally eventually lose interest in paying maintenance fees. From then onward, the number of cryopreservations would grow exponentially, but to this day still represent a trivial amount in comparison to the number of burials and cremations. Since cryonics was first publicized, an estimated 2.9 billion people have died,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ortiz-Ospina|first=Esteban|last2=Roser|first2=Max|date=2019-01-23|title=World Population Growth|url=https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth|journal=Our World in Data}}</ref> which could represent about 2.7% of humans to have ever lived.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prb.org/howmanypeoplehaveeverlivedonearth/|title=How Many People Have Ever Lived on Earth? – Population Reference Bureau|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-23}}</ref> As of January 2019, 416 people are known to be cryopreserved.

The following graph shows a history of the number of bodies preserved (complete or neuro-only). Given that the quality of preservations varies a lot, and it can often take many hours or even days before someone gets preserved from the time of their clinical death,<ref name="AlcorCase"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cryonics.org/case-reports/|title=Case Reports {{!}} Cryonics Institute|website=www.cryonics.org|access-date=2019-01-23}}</ref> the graph below represents an upper bound of the number of people that are preserved: some have probably been irreversibly lost, and some might only have been partially preserved. Given that we don't currently know how effective current preservation methods are, the lower bound for the number of people that have been preserved remains 0.

The following graph shows the number of patients over time for many organizations.

[[File:Cryopreservation_count_per_organisation_over_time.png]]

==== Members ====
Memberships statistics can be tricky to track for a couple of reasons:
* Lack of present data: some organizations don't publicize their membership statistics
* Lack of historical data: some organizations only started tracking their membership statistics later in their history
* Lack of cryonics membership data: the Cryonics Institute stopped publicizing the number of their members that are fully-funded since 2015, and now only reports the number of members they have; some are also members only for other of their services, such as DNA preservation
* Dual memberships: some cryonicists are members of more than one organization, often to support several organizations, or as a fall-back for themselves if one organization was to fail in some ways.

Alcor is the only large cryonics organization that has tracked the number of fully-funded members it has had since its beginnings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://alcor.org/AboutAlcor/membershipstats.html|title=Alcor: Membership Statistics|website=alcor.org|access-date=2019-01-23}}</ref> All Alcor members are subscribed to standby services. The Cryonics Institute has tracked the number of members it has signed up with standby services since it started offering it in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cryonics.org/ci-landing/member-statistics/|title=Member Statistics {{!}} Cryonics Institute|website=www.cryonics.org|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> It also has a lot of members that are signed up but plan to use the services of a funeral director for transport{{snd}}this number is however unknown to the public. The graph below tracks those two numbers. The recent growth has been pretty linear. However, given that there are more and more cryonics organizations, worldwide cryonics memberships is likely growing exponentially.

[[File:Number_of_members_2019-01.png]]

=== Cost ===
Alcor and the Cryonics Institute are the main cryonics providers that have existed for decades.<ref group=note>Trans Time has also existed for a long time, but they haven't always been offering cryonics services, and only have 3 patients in storage. The American Cryonics Society has also existed for a long time, but they contract with other cryonics providers.</ref> Alcor has been adjusting its prices according to the Consumer Price Index (which has been lower than medical inflation), while the Cryonics Institute has maintained its initial price. The first graph below shows the [[wikipedia:Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal cost]] charged by the organization, while the second graph shows the [[wikipedia:Real versus nominal value (economics)|real cost]] (that is inflation adjusted) of various cryonics services. 

While the graphs start in 1976, it is worth noting that before 1982, Alcor was contracting Trans Time for its storage services, and the Institute for Advanced Biological Studies for its stabilization services. Also, besides Ettinger's mother and wife, the first patient of the Cryonics Institute was preserved in 1991.

A direct comparison between the prices of different organizations is difficult because of the different services provided, and different types of payments. For example, Alcor has an annual membership fee and has surcharges for late-minute cases. Some of the reason for Alcor's higher price than the Cryonics Institute includes the cost of stabilization and transport, as well as being more financially conservative by putting more money aside in a patient care trust.

The graphs below show the price of cryonics for whole-body and / or neuro-only as offered by Alcor<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://alcor.org/Library/html/CryopreservationFundingAndInflation.html|title=Crypreservation Funding and Inflation|website=alcor.org|access-date=2019-01-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://alcor.org/BecomeMember/|title=Alcor: Membership Info - How to Join|website=alcor.org|access-date=2019-01-31}}</ref>, the Cryonics Institute<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cryonics.org/ci-landing/funding-for-cryostasis/|title=Funding for Cryostasis {{!}} Cryonics Institute|website=www.cryonics.org|access-date=2019-01-31}}</ref>, OregonCryo<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://oregoncryo.com/services.html|title=Oregon Cryonics - Services|website=oregoncryo.com|access-date=2019-01-31}}</ref>, KrioRus<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kriorus.ru/en/Human-cryopreservation|title=Human cryopreservation {{!}} KrioRus|website=kriorus.ru|access-date=2019-01-31}}</ref>.

! Time period !! Development summary
|-
| 1897-1961 || Early cryobiology research starts, and reaches one of the first important success by cryopreserving human sperms by 1961.
During that time, the idea of cryonics is conceived by various people; presumably independently from each other. In 1901, Porfiry Ivanovich Bakhmetyev suggests using the phenomenon of anabiosis to prolong human life, to “travel to the future”. In 1931, Neil R. Jones writes a story about someone preserved in orbit due to the cold temperature. In 1948, Robert Ettinger publishes a story on suspended animation, which addresses various cryonics issues. In 1962, Evan Cooper publishes "Immortality: Physically, Scientifically, Now" and coins the slogan "freeze, wait, reanimate". In the same year, Ettinger privately publishes "The Prospect of Immortality" which would be pivotal for the growth of cryonics.
|-
| 1960-1966 || The first cryonics activists start grouping and developing the capabilities to perform cryopreservations. They have difficulty finding a first person interested in receiving the procedure.
|-
| 1966-1975 || Early cryonics organizations struggle to maintain their patients in liquid nitrogen. Out of 22 cryopreservations done during that period, only 3 would remain preserved to this day [2020].
|-
| 1974-1990 || The two cryonics organizations that have provided continuous service for the longest time and have the most members, Alcor and the Cryonics Institute, are created in 1976. They would slowly grow during the following years. The American Cryonics Society would have patients under its responsibility from 1974 up to this day [2020].
|-
| 1991-2000 || The Cryonics Institute preserves their third patient in 1991{{snd}}the first two being relatives from the founder, {{W|Robert Ettinger}}. Alcor and the Cryonics Institute start getting more members and patients.
|-
| 2001-2018 || Alcor starts using a vitrification solution in 2001, and the Cryonics Institute follows in 2004. In 2018, Mike Darwin reports, from CT scans he analyzed, that Alcor member Fred Chamberlain III, cryopreserved in 2012, was the first patient to demonstratively have their brain cryopreserved essentially ice-free. In 2015, {{W|21st Century Medicine}} wins a prize from the {{W|Brain Preservation Foundation}} for having demonstrably preserved the connectome of a pig with a technique combining vitrification and fixation.

He would store his body at Trans Time from 1990 to 1993.

Bauge would then transport his grandfather to [[wikipedia:Nederland, Colorado|Nederland, Colorado]] in dry ice with the intention of starting his own cryonics company.

After media turmoil, the town would outlaw cryonics, but would "grandfather the grandfather" who would remain there on dry ice.<ref name="BenBestCryonicsHistory"/>

[...] Second, early advocates of cryonics and MNT spoke and wrote in a way that was critical and dismissive toward the most relevant mainstream scientific fields [...] Third, [...] these “neighboring” established scientific communities (of cryobiologists and chemists) engaged in substantial “boundary work” to keep advocates of cryonics and MNT excluded."<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/history-of-philanthropy/some-case-studies-early-field-growth#FailureModes|title = Some Case Studies in Early Field Growth: Failure modes in cryonics and molecular nanotechnology|last = Muehlhauser|first = Luke|publisher = Open Philanthropy|language = en|date = 2017-04-26|accessdate = 2020-07-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/new-report-early-field-growth|title = New Report on Early Field Growth|last = Muehlhauser|first = Luke|publisher = Open Philanthropy|language = en|date = 2017-04-26|accessdate = 2020-07-05}}</ref>

Preferences regarding disposition of postmortem human bodies or brains are clearly a matter of personal choice and, therefore, inappropriate subjects of Society policy. The Society does, however, take the position that the knowledge necessary for the revival of live or dead whole mammals following cryopreservation does not currently exist and can come only from conscientious and patient research in cryobiology and medicine. In short, the act of preserving a body, head or brain after clinical death and storing it indefinitely on the chance that some future generation may restore it to life is an act of speculation or hope, not science, and as such is outside the purview of the Society for Cryobiology."</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.societyforcryobiology.org/assets/documents/Position_Statement_Cryonics_Nov_18.pdf|title=Society for Cryobiology Position Statement - Cryonics|last=|first=|date=November 2018|website=Society for Cryobiology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-23}}</ref>

== More information ==
Some events that weren't important enough to make it into this timeline are noted on the Discussion page (as well as on the Google Sheet [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uEvT8oHOQJOOYzYglkFgrEgKbhbkz1A0jdO5OYZPwEk/ Timeline of cryonics - extended timeline]).

An exhaustive list of publicly known preserved patients (including a yet incomplete evaluation of the quality of their preservation) can be found in the Google Sheet [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vBrlNvPkPQbLKxtSUlTF_ZpUS4lwW2W7lENRj9Gdk3I List of cryonics patients].

A detailed account of membership statistics of cryonics organizations has been compiled in the Google Sheet [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CW5tyCLp-jGT4ta4k1esDaw-I2eKd7rcI7jhcQEk4NE/ Cryonic members statistics] (although not all organizations share all or any of their membership statistics). A detailed account of patient statistics has been compiled in the Google Sheet [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15Ix7iocvo5WdNgtC3MSkYlyysV95_TrJjK87Z371FrY/ Cryonic patients statistics]. The membership and patient statistics should be updated at the beginning of every year, after the publication of the statistics from last year.

== Meta information on the timeline ==

=== Timeline update strategy ===
As of 2020, [[User:Mati Roy|Mati Roy]] is currently roughly staying up-to-date with new major cryonics events, and should, therefore, update the timeline roughly continuously, at least in the near future. If you're interested in helping in any way, feel free to take the initiative. If you have any questions, want guidance or feedback, want to discuss ways to improve this timeline, or have a suggestion for an addition to this timeline, let [[User:Mati Roy|Mati]] know on the [https://www.reddit.com/r/TimelinesWiki/ TimelinesWiki Subreddit] or [https://www.facebook.com/groups/TimelinesWiki/ TimelinesWiki Facebook Group] (and link me the post) or contact me directly at contact@matiroy.com.

Also see the section "More information" for other related information that can be updated or otherwise improved. All those external lists are editable, and everyone is encouraged to contribute to them. They are all available in the Google Folder [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zRQIIVmh8Io-Ao5HZV1UtzkWTY61wbFI Cryonics Statistics]. The graphs from the [[#Trends|Trends section]] can be updated whenever the relevant external lists are.

An older version of the timeline is available on Google Sheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uEvT8oHOQJOOYzYglkFgrEgKbhbkz1A0jdO5OYZPwEk/ Timeline of brain preservation].

=== To do ===
* Add: March 2020 news and updates, creation of the Alcor Longevity Circle of Distinguished Donors
* Make a graph of historical money spent on cryonics by members, philanthropists and other interest groups.
* Read [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743919115012790?via%3Dihub Emergency preservation and resuscitation for cardiac arrest from trauma] to add the major milestones of the used of hypothermia.
* Read [https://www.createursdemondes.fr/veille-techno/bio-informatique-genetique/vivre-eternellement/cryogenisation-des-corps-ou-cryonie/ CRYOGÉNISATION DES CORPS OU “CRYONIE”] and add missing relevant events
* Add publication from Argentina about their preservation in 2018
* Add {{W|The Door into Summer}} (although probably not notable enough for the main timeline)
* Add info from the [https://www.icryonic.com/sobre-icryonic/investigacion-y-desarrollo/ iCryonics World Lab timeline] (although maybe it should go in the extended timeline, at least for now)

=== Terminology ===
By default, [[User:Mati Roy|Mati Roy]] suggests using the [http://www.oregoncryo.com/terminology.html terminology proposed by OregonCryo].

=== Tracking preservation quality ===
An interesting addition that could be done to this page is to measure the progress of the quality of cryonics cases. If you're interested in contributing to this project, you can fill the columns related to the quality of the cryopreservation in the Google Sheet [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vBrlNvPkPQbLKxtSUlTF_ZpUS4lwW2W7lENRj9Gdk3I List of cryonics patients] by going through some of the cases published by the cryonics organizations; see: [https://alcor.org/cases.html Alcor (human cases)], the [https://www.cryonics.org/case-reports/ Cryonics Institute (human cases)], [http://www.oregoncryo.com/caseReports.html OregonCryo (human cases)], [http://www.oregoncryo.com/caseReportsPets.html OregonCryo (non-human cases)], [http://kriorus.ru/Krionirovannye-lyudi KrioRus (human cases)], [http://kriorus.ru/Zhivotnye-kriopacienty KrioRus (non-human cases)].

While ways to quantify the quality of preservations have been proposed, notably by [http://www.oregoncryo.com/qualityScores.html OregonCryo], there are currently no systematic analyses done about the quality of current preservations by any of the cryonics providers.

As for the improvements done in laboratory conditions, progress is better tracked by noting various discrete technological development as done in the full timeline above.

While having a graph tracking the [https://github.com/RomanPlusPlus/scientific-progress-towards-cryonics "biggest mass of a successfully cryopreserved tissue/organ/organism by year, kg"] is appealing, it doesn't meaningfully track progress done on brain preservations which pose a series of challenges not present in smaller volumes of tissue as [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eGVzwmr1TDgN9HnDfTZNnzP98-hipHoc/ noted by Mike Darwin]. This can still be found on the Discussion page.

=== Acknowledgement ===
[[User:Mati Roy|Mati Roy]] created the first version of the timeline of brain preservation published here with [https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/tasks.php?receptacle=Timeline+of+brain+preservation&matching=exact payment from Vipul]. [[User:Mati Roy|Mati Roy]] also created and is maintaining, with the help of other volunteers, all of the Google Sheets mentioned in the section [[#More information]]. Most of the membership statistics were entered by Marta Sandberg. {{W|Mike Darwin}} contributed a lot of information on notable technological progress on [https://www.reddit.com/r/longevity/comments/ajanjs/timeline_of_cryonics/ Reddit]. {{W|Mike Darwin}} and [[User:Issa|Issa Rice]] provided a lot of useful feedback. Alexey Potapov, Marta Sandberg, as well as others contributed ideas for events to add. The graph and table tracking [https://github.com/RomanPlusPlus/scientific-progress-towards-cryonics Scientific progress towards cryonics] was created by Roman.

In January 2020, [[User:Mati Roy|Mati Roy]] updated the timeline, and Jim Yount, CEO of the American Cryonics Society, provided a lot of useful feedback.
