It is revealed that Alameda rests on a foundation largely made up of a coin that a sister company invented, instead of an independent asset like a fiat currency or another crypto. Total assets totalling $14.6 billion are reported to be comprised of $5.8 billion FTT token, $1.2 billion Solana token (SOL), $3.37 billion in unidentified “crypto held,” $2 billion in “investments in equity securities”, leaving roughly $2.2 billion in assets.
