| November 2 || 2:44 p.m. || Ian Allison, <code>coindesk.com</code> || Article || || An article at <code>coindesk.com</code> by Ian Allison shares some critical financial details from Alameda Research, revealing that its balance sheet is full of the FTT token, which is issued by the exchange that grants holders a discount on trading fees on its marketplace. It is revealed that Alameda rests on a foundation largely made up of a coin that a sister company invented, instead of an independent asset like a fiat currency or another crypto. Total assets totalling $14.6 billion are reported to be comprised of $5.8 billion FTT token, $1.2 billion Solana token (SOL), $3.37 billion in unidentified ‚Äúcrypto held,‚Äù $2 billion in ‚Äúinvestments in equity securities‚Äù, leaving roughly $2.2 billion in assets. According to this balance sheet, Alameda only had $134 million in cash on hand in June 2022.<ref name=sdf/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Allison |first1=Ian |title=Divisions in Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs Crypto Empire Blur on His Trading Titan Alameda‚Äôs Balance Sheet |url=https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/02/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet/ |website=www.coindesk.com |access-date=12 November 2022 |language=en |date=2 November 2022}}</ref>
