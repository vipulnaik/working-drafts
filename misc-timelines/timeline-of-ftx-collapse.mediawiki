It is revealed that Alameda rests on a foundation largely made up of a coin that a sister company invented, instead of an independent asset like a fiat currency or another crypto. Total assets totalling $14.6 billion are reported to be comprised of $5.8 billion FTT token, $1.2 billion Solana token (SOL), $3.37 billion in unidentified “crypto held,” $2 billion in “investments in equity securities”, leaving roughly $2.2 billion in assets. According to this balance sheet, Alameda only had $134 million in cash on hand in June 2022.<ref name=sdf/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Allison |first1=Ian |title=Divisions in Sam Bankman-Fried’s Crypto Empire Blur on His Trading Titan Alameda’s Balance Sheet |url=https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/02/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet/ |website=www.coindesk.com |access-date=12 November 2022 |language=en |date=2 November 2022}}</ref> Regarding FTT, Alameda is found to hold far more of the tokens than traded on the market, suggesting its stake would be hard to liquidate at current prices.<ref name="team"/>
