Acronyms:

SRD = search ranking-driven. We will only check for SRD for slight and large increases and decreases. Negligible changes won't be diagnosed.

LI = large increase (more than 2x the previous data point)
SI = slight increase (1.15-2x the previous data point)
NI = negligible increase (1-1.15x the previous data point)
NN = neutral (same as previous data point)
ND = negligible decrease (0.9-1x the previous data point)
SD = slight decrease (0.5-1x the previous data point)
LD = large decrease (less than 0.5x the previous data point)
