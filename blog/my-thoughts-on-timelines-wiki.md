# My thoughts on timelines wiki

I have been involved with [timelines
wiki](https://timelines.issarice.com/) both as a contributor of
content and as a funder of other contributors. In this article, I go
over my history with timelines, my thoughts on timelines, why I'm
continuing to contribute in these two ways, and how my relationship
with timelines might evolve over time.

## My history with timelines in general (and with timelines wiki in particular)

### Introduction to timelines on Wikipedia

I have been editing Wikipedia content off and on since the
mid-2000s. In 2013, I discovered and made my [first
edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Timeline_of_Facebook&oldid=535051698)
to the timeline of Facebook. The timeline at the time didn't even have
a sortable tabular format; it was just arranged into sections by year.

In late January and early February of 2014, I started restructuring
the timeline of Facebook into a tabular timeline; the first edit from
January 23 is
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Timeline_of_Facebook&diff=592075328&oldid=591985206)
and the timeline after I finished that round of edits (over about two
weeks) is
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Timeline_of_Facebook&oldid=594236154). The
timeline at that point already reflects many of the hallmarks of
timelines as they now exist on timelines wiki: a big picture-like
section (called "Major trends" by me at the time) and a "Full
timeline" section. At around the same time as I started converting the
timeline of Facebook to a tabular timeline, I also created a timeline
of Twitter
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Timeline_of_Twitter&oldid=592093659),
using the tabular format right at the outset.

I continued adding and editing timelines in tabular format on
Wikipedia, mostly related to technology companies, through 2014 and
2015.

### Contract work for timelines on Wikipedia (April/May 2015 to beginning of March 2017)

In 2015, I started farming out contract work to a couple of people:
[Issa
Rice](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Issa+Rice)
and [Alex
K. Chen](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Alex+K.+Chen). While
the contract work covered many things, timelines on Wikipedia were one
category of stuff they covered. The first such timeline was the
timeline of Reddit --
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Timeline_of_Reddit&oldid=664650347)
is the completed version that I paid for.

In total, I appear to have spent $2,350 directly on 24 timelines by
Alex K. Chen, all on Wikipedia, in 2015 and 2016 (I also paid for
other non-timeline stuff, that I'm not including here). There were
also additional payments associated with the pages he created
(including pageviews-based payment) that is a bit harder to factor
in. Information on the timelines is on his [worker
page](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Alex+K.+Chen).

In April 2016, Sebastian Sanchez responded to my [EA Forum
post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/yBwTcKHWv9Lgunhrm/looking-for-wikipedia-article-writers-topics-include-many-of)
and started doing contract work for me (Sebastian and I were already
friendson Facebook who had been introduced through a mutual friend,
but we didn't have much communication prior to this). Sebastian has
been doing contract work for me since April 2016 all the way till
2024, as of my time of writing this post. You can see more details on
his [worker
page](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/worker.php?worker=Sebastian+Sanchez). Sebastian's
initial work was on Wikipedia, with a large fraction of it being on
timelines, including stuff like timelines of healthcare in specific
countries and timelines of various diseases. The very first timeline
was timeline of cholera; unfortunately, this has since been deleted
from Wikipedia but [here's the oldest version on timelines
wiki](https://timelines.issarice.com/index.php?title=Timeline_of_cholera&oldid=11772)
that was right after it was ported from Wikipedia.

### Exiting Wikipedia and forming timelines wiki (March 2017)

In March 2017, our work on Wikipedia got into trouble because of the
use of payments to sponsor Wikipedia content. While, to my
understanding, we didn't violate Wikipedia policies, the controversy
made it difficult to continue operating. Not only that, a lot of the
existing content was getting deleted, including many health-related
timelines. See the links at the bottom of my [sponsored Wikipedia
editing](https://vipulnaik.com/sponsored-wikipedia-editing/) page.

Issa Rice, who had done some content creation on Wikipedia
and was in general doing a lot of contract work for me at the time,
took the initiative of setting up timelines.issarice.com and migrating
the timelines there, to give us a space to continue working on the
timelines. Thus, timelines wiki was born in March 2017.

I decided to continue my sponsorship of timelines creation and
expansion work by the contract workers (at this point, it was just
Issa Rice and Sebastian Sanchez).

### Since then (2017 to present)

Issa's direct editorial contributions to timelines wiki were strong
for the first couple of years, but as his interests morphed, he moved
on to other things, and later took a career break to handle his
chronic illness (see [here](https://issarice.com/about)). Sebastian
has been working mostly steadily on timelines wiki from 2017 to
present (about 2024 as of the time of writing this) though he has also
done some other work, including on [Org
Watch](https://orgwatch.issarice.com/).

I have also spent time off and on creating and editing timelines
myself, though I don't get to pay myself for my timelines.

A few others have created or contributed to isolated timelines on
timelines wiki, including Orpheus Lummis for [timeline of prediction
markets](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_prediction_markets)
and Mati Roy for [timeline of brain
preservation](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_brain_preservation). In
both cases I made one-off payments to them for their work.

Sebastian also did some work on timelines wiki for the Future Fund
Regranting Program until the residual funds were clawed back by the
FTX creditors; see
[here](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/payer.php?payer=Future+Fund+Regranting+Program)
for the list of work funded that way.
