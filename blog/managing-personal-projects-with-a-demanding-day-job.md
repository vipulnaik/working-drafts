# Managing personal projects with a demanding day job

My [day job](https://vipulnaik.com/job/) is pretty demanding (and also
pays well enough). I have a reasonable amount of responsibility and,
in addition to a steady stream of work, there is also the occasional
unexpected work popping up at odd hours.

I have a number of personal projects that I would like to see steady
progress on. Some of the personal projects are things I'm doing on my
own; some are collaborative. Most have a "make the world a better
place" flavor, though I don't know if they would be considered
philanthropic or effective altruist in a typical sense. Some are more
around bookkeeping, but the bookkeeping may be made more important
because of the other projects I'm working on. For instance, I've been
spending a lot of time on [financial
bookkeeping](https://finances.vipulnaik.com/), and one reason for that
is that my [significant expenditure on contract
work](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/) means I need to think more
about my finances than somebody else with my income level might.

Dealing with my day job as well as personal projects is a
challenge. My lips are somewhat sealed when it comes to the
strategies I employ on the day job side of this challenge, but I'll
talk about the approaches I am trying to use on the personal project
side, as well as on finding the balance.

The ideas here may be interesting to others, though I make no claims
about applicability to other people. One key factor that might differ
for other people: I don't have a lot of ongoing family
responsibilities and other social responsibilities; any things I do on
these fronts are sporadic. My life therefore boils down to work,
personal projects, chores (like shopping, cooking, and laundry), and
entertainment. Adding in significant ongoing family and social
responsibilities may change the dynamic.

To get a sense of the kind of day-to-day tasks I do for both personal
projects and chores, see my [daily updates
issues](https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/issues?q=is%3Aissue)
(tabulated in the [updates.vipulnaik.com
portal](https://updates.vipulnaik.com/)); see
[here](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JvTM68yzurLzJ3Xua/the-why-and-how-of-daily-updates)
for more about my use of daily update issues.

Here is a list of sections:

* Hard time-based separations ("boundaries"), and why I didn't find
  them too practical or useful
* Delegation in personal projects
* Thinking about progress when time levels and timelines are very uncertain
* The alternation strategy that I'm trying out
* Administrative tasks (such as peresonal finances portal, daily updates portal)
* Why keep such a demanding day job?
* How did writing this post help and what could I not do?

## Hard time-based separations ("boundaries"), and why I didn't find them too practical or useful

A common strategy for dealing with what's called work-life balance is
the idea of clear time-based boundaries. For instance, commit to
working within the hours of 9 AM to 6 PM on weekdays, and doing
non-work stuff during other times.

There are two main advantages I see of boundaries. First, the clear
time separation allows for a greater level of focus for each
activity. This reduces the decision overhead, and the greater focus
also means more of a sense of flow, and probably better output. In
this story, during work hours, I can focus more on work, because I
have committed the hours to work. During non-work hours, I can focus
more completely on personal projects. It's a win-win.

Second, a deliberate decision on how to set boundaries might help set
the balance in a proportion that is more suited to what I consciously
want, rather than being swayed by the situation. For instance, let's
say I have observed that, on average, I am spending way more time on
work than I think I should with the right balance. By setting specific
hours for work, I can cap the time I spend on work, reducing the
overwork, and guaranteeing some minimum amount of time on personal
projects.

There are, however, a few problems with the set hours approach, that I
think outweigh the benefits.

First, a lot of my day job work involves coordination with others,
including coworkers and customers. Different people work in different
timezones. I'm in Berkeley, California and therefore follow Pacific
Time. Starting my day early allows me effective coordination with
colleagues on the East Coast of the United States as well as those on
the West Coast who start their day early, deal with questions from
customers in Europe, and also coordinate with a co-worker based in
South Asia. The majority of my colleagues, though, work roughly 9 AM
to 7 PM, and some of our customers in Japan benefit from my
availability late in the evenings. Maintaining some level of
availability throughout the day helps a lot. Cutting down on
availability can lead to significant delays.

For instance, if a colleague who works 11 AM to 7 PM asks me a
question at 5 PM, replying immediately can unblock him for his
remaining two hours of work, whereas waiting till the morning to reply
means he will only be able to act on it the next day.

The second problem has to do with my own mood and energy levels. There
are times when I have the energy to work long hours, and other times
when even getting through a normal work day is difficult, but I do
have a lot of energy to do a fun personal project.

The third problem is that a set hours approach fails to account for
the nature of the job. Fundamentally, the job involves executing on
some responsibilities and deliverables, rather than clocking time. The
way to achieve those deliverables can vary widely over time. Setting
hours in advance can be too crude.

With these problems in mind, here are some things I have adopted
instead:

* Time tracking: I track my time fairly meticulously for my day job,
  and somewhat less meticulously for personal projects. With time
  tracking, I have a rough sense if I am spending more time on work
  than I'd like. While I don't set either minimum targets or caps on
  time spent working, I may, on a case-by-case basis, decide I have
  worked "enough" for the day or "too little" for the day. This would
  be in combination with other factors like work urgency. Time
  tracking has other benefits, mostly around understanding priorities
  within work, but I will skip them here.

* Indulgences: When I have a strong desire to work on a personal
  project, I'll just indulge in it, even during normal work hours,
  while still being available to deal with anything that comes up
  suddenly at work. Conversely, if I feel like wrapping up a work item
  will give me a lot of satisfaction, I might do so even during time
  that I would normally spend on personal projects. Indulgences of
  this kind are sometimes costly, but the feeling of satisfaction
  makes it worth it. Indulgences are also an important source of
  spontaneity and variety in an otherwise monotonous life,
  particularly at a time when external sources of spontaneity are
  reduced due to staying at home in the face of COVID-19.

* No promises: My biggest sources of work-related stress have come
  from situations where I had "promised" myself a time of relaxation,
  and then some work popped up at the last minute that took
  precedence. Without the promise (that had gotten my hopes high) I
  would have been better equipped to accept the work. Instead, I
  needed to figure out other, more indirect, ways to achieve the
  benefits that I was using "promises" to obtain. [Promises are a
  weaker form of boundaries, in the sense that a promise is just a
  determination to apply a boundary in specific instances, but that
  too has proven a source of disappointment.]

## Delegation in personal projects

For the last five years, I've been [funding contract
work](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/). A decent share of this
contract work is work that I might have done myself if, let's say, I
didn't have a day job and had all my time available to pursue personal
projects. My day job makes me money but uses my time; by funding
contract work, I am using that money to buy back time, albeit not my
own, to make progress in the personal projects.

In practice, a lot of the stuff I've funded has had slightly different
focus from what I would have done myself. That's partly because the
selection of work fits the strength of the worker. Still, the
framework of the preceding paragraph offers a useful way to think
about why I'm funding contract work.

A couple of considerations come to mind. One is around whether the
value of personal projects to me is centered around me being the
person doing them, or whether delegation gives me the same value. The
answer varies by project; I'm delegating more for the kinds of work
where most of the value is from it getting done than from me
specifically being the doer.

Another is around the time/money tradeoff. Could I take a job that
makes less money but gives me more time for personal projects, so I
can do more direct work on personal projects, and possibly reduce the
contract work I fund? I discuss that more in the second-to-last
section, but for the near term, I don't plan to drastically change my
job situation.

At a very high level, my conclusion is that even though I appear to
have paid a lot (~$150,000) for contract work, I expect that by taking
a lower-paying job that gives me enough time to do similar work
myself, I would have lost a comparable amount in forgone wages. If
it's reasonable to take a lower-paying job to have enough time for
pursuits of personal importance, I think funding contract work is
reasonable. Also, I have gotten better over the years at figuring out
what to fund, and at structuring the tasks to be more efficient,
working in close collaboration with Issa and Sebastian, the main
contract workers. So, you'd probably find that the work I funded in
the early years (2015 to 2017) on average provides less value for
money than the work I funded in the later years (2018 to 2020).

I understand that the above is far from a satisfactory description or
explanation of my funding of contract work; interested readers are
encouraged to explore the [contract work
portal](https://contractwork.vipulnaik.com/). I might write more of a
retrospective on funding contract work in the next few years.

## Thinking about progress when time levels and timelines are very uncertain

In many cases, my personal projects move very slowly. This is largely
because of the demanding nature of my day job, but also because of a
lot of competition for my time between the various personal
projects. This means that, even for moderate *amounts* of progress, I
need to set an internal expectation that that progress will take
several months. For instance, even if a task takes just ten hours, I
might expect it to take three calendar months to finish. This is
particularly true of the tasks that I cannot or do not want to
delegate. Further complicating this picture is my mood, due to which I
may choose to spend a large share of personal project time on
indulgences.

To handle this and not set myself up for disappointment, I avoid
setting specific date deadlines for personal projects where such a
deadline is not externally imposed. Instead, I mostly impose a loose
relative ordering within each project, and a general priority
ordering between projects. This relative ordering is subject to
tweaking, particularly to accommodate indulgences, but it provides a
general framework. If the relative ordering is reasonable, and I end
up getting enough time on personal projects, I will overall make
reasonable progress.

Even so, I sometimes feel guilt at "neglecting" a project, or having
simple tasks (that in all rights are a few hours of work) take several
months. I have to then remind myself that, during those months I have
not been idle; I've been doing other tasks that I prioritized more
highly. And at a higher level, I remind myself that my decision to
continue to work at a demanding, and well-paying, day job is one of
the root causes of the slow progress.

## The alternation strategy that I'm trying out

Of late, I am trying a strategy of having two main personal projects
active. I'll be working on either one of them at a given time, and
when I tire of it, I'll switch to the other one. I will also try to
restrict indulgences to within those two projects, if feasible (though
possibly outside of my sequence of work within those projects).

These are some of my criteria for the two projects:

* The amount of time it takes for me to tire on either project is more
  than the amount of time I need to recover from either project (while
  I'm doing the other project). For instance, it takes me at least two
  calendar weeks of work on either project to tire from it, and I can
  recover in one week. Technically, all I need is that the time to
  tire from each project is longer than the time to recover fromm the
  other project, so that I can successfully alternate.

  If this cannot be achieved, then I need more than two projects to
  alternate between.

* Both projects are important to me.

* Both projects are easy to break down into small time chunks, and
  both projects allow for rapid context-switching out of them, and
  pausing for several weeks due to the other project or due to day job
  responsibilities.

Changing the set of two projects will usually happen at least one step
in advance; for instance, if I'm alternating between A and B, then at
some point when doing A, I may decide to switch to alternating between
A and C. Then I'll complete my current stint on A and switch to C
instead of switching to B.

## Administrative tasks (such as personal finances portal, daily updates portal)

At present, a lot of my non-work time goes into tasks that are
administrative overhead of some sort. For instance, I am spending some
time on backfilling data for
[updates.vipulnaik.com](https://updates.vipulnaik.com/), and I also
worked off and on starting around December 2019 putting together my
[finances portal](https://finances.vipulnaik.com/). I have also been
backfilling my income and taxes data over the past few years. And I've
been both backfilling and keeping up-to-date my [diet, exercise, and
health
data](https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/commits).

Less importantly (and more fun) I'm also [backfilling my entertainment
and self-education
data](https://github.com/vipulnaik/entertainment-and-self-education/commits)
(portal forthcoming!), though I expect that to be a more time-limited
activity.

These projects are neither the height of fun, nor do they fall under
"personal projects" that I have a direct desire to see progress in. In
my time tracking (shown on
[updates.vipulnaik.com](https://updates.vipulnaik.com/)), I don't track
work on any of these under personal projects. I track personal
finances, income and taxes as a separate category. I track daily
updates work under personal chores, and I track entertainment ald
self-education portal work under other activities.

Thus, there is a big question around whether it's wise to be
spending so much time on these administrative overheads, particularly
given the already-fairly-limited time I have available for non-work
items.

I go over some of the reasons for spending as much time as I do on
these administrative tasks, as well as the criteria for picking some
administrative tasks instead of others.

### Ongoing overhead of administrative tasks should be low (excluding backfill and setup)

I try to design administrative tasks so that the ongoing overhead,
excluding backfill work and setup work, is fairly low. Moreover, setup
work shouldn't be too high, and backfill should be doable at my own
pace, without blocking the value of the rest of the project.

For instance, with personal finances, the ongoing work is mostly a
monthly update of balances, a few occasional updates to accrued
expenses when I buy stuff outside the normal purchases, and quarterly
or semi-annual systematic updates of accrued expenses. For income and
taxes, there is also annual calculation of income and taxes across
various jurisdictions where I can be taxed. In addition, occasionally
I may investigate opportunities to invest or rearrange money, but
these are usually not time-sensitive.

This is not a lot of work! But in the last few months, I have been
spending way more time on personal finances than what you'd predict
looking at the above. The remaining time is mostly going into
backfilling finances data for the past ten years, so that I can more
accurately understand patterns and trends. Most of that is because
I've essentially been trying to catch up in less than a year on ten
years of finances; moreover, for the earlier years, some
archaeological effort is needed to reconstruct what happened, because
I don't have all data in a computable format, and I don't remember
things that well. As of the end of August 2020, I have perhaps 5 to 8
more hours of work to mostly wrap up the backfill, but it's quite
non-urgent, so I've beeen prioritizing other tasks.

A similar story applies to daily updates. I started creating daily
updates issues in August 2018. I got the idea of the daily updates
portal in July 2020, and started working on backfilling data to August
2018, while keeping data up-to-date going forward. Through the latter
half of July and all of August, I was able to backfill data till
around mid-August 2019. I expect that in another two months I would
have completed the backfill, at which point we'd be down to about ten
minutes a week on updating data in the portal (in addition to some
time spent creating the updates, but that is usually part of the
budgets for other tasks).

## Why keep such a demanding job?

I think there is a good chance that in the longer term, I will look
for lower-paying, less time-intensive jobs, or possibly even stop work
completely. However, for the near term, both financial considerations
(building a savings buffer) and other considerations (reduced mobility
due to COVID-19, immigration laws that require me to be in a
high-paying job to maintain status) push me toward maintaining the
status quo.

### Financial considerations

For more background, see my [personal finances
website](https://finances.vipulnaik.com/).

My current expectation is that, with the pay and expenses I currently
have (including contract work) I will save a minimum of $2,750 per
month on average; this is extrapolated from my 2019 saving rate. My
saving rate in 2020 so far has been higher, but 2019 probably gives a
more accurate picture; I happen to have not made any donations in 2020
yet, and I also have spent a little less on contract work in 2020 and
expect to scale that back up to 2019 levels.

Ideally, I would like to get to a level of savings that is sufficient
to cover about seven years of current expenses (excluding contract
work and donations). (I expect that I could cut down my actual
expenses a lot if I weren't working, because rent and health insurance
form a large fraction of my expenses outside contract work and
donations, and moving to a cheaper area could cut these expenses a
lot, but it's also possible that expenses will increase due to other
personal circumstances or family responsibilities). At the current
rate of saving, I expect to hit that level in three years.

### Immigration status considerations

I'm currently living in the United States on a H-1B, and have a
pending green card application (I-140 approved, waiting for priority
date to become current). Currently, applications from 2009 are being
processed for my category (my date is 2019), so if the processing is
linear, I expect to wait another ten years. However, various sources
have estimated that the backlog is growing, and estimates for when
it'll finally be my turn vary from twenty to over a hundred years.

Until that time, in order to stay in the United States, I would need
to stay continuously employed in a roughly similar job to my current
one. However, I could leave the United States and then come to the
United States again on H-1B, while I await my priority date.

Keeping the current type of job for more than a decade is not an
exciting long-term prospect for me. In the longer term, I want
the freedom to switch to a lower-paying or part-time job to give
myself more time for personal projects.

As I see it, there are a few different long-term possibilities. First,
I find some other reason to stay in the United States long-term that
gives me freedom to quit my job. The three likely ways are: (a)
upgrading my application type (EB-2 to EB-1) so I have to wait "only"
about five years, (b) making a lot of money and going the EB-5
(investor/entrepreneur) visa route, that would again take at least two
years after I make the money, or (c) marriage. Marriage is obviously a
little different than the others in that I won't do this purely to get
a green card, but it's also the only one of the three that will create
a genuine additional motivation for me to stay in the United States;
on another note, I think marriage will further decrease my desire to
continue a demanding day job, because I definitely can't juggle
demanding day job, personal projects, *and* family, and I think
demanding day job will be first on the chopping block.

Second, I could leave the United States after a few years, once I want
to stop doing the current type of job. The good thing about having a
pending green card application is that I have the ability to come to
the United States for work on similar lines at any time in the
future.

The decision of which route to go is a little complex, but what the
immigration status considerations make clear is that I will
simultaneously have to change on many fronts. I can't quit my job and
still stay where I am, spending a few months to figure out next
steps. I have to quit my job and leave the United States at pretty
much the same time. The coordinated nature of these changes makes them
more complex, which also pushes me toward sticking to the status quo
till I have a clear alternate plan in mind.

### COVID-19 considerations

I expect that it'll take about three years for the world to fully
recover from COVID-19. Until that time, it seems risky for me to make
changes to my job or physical location, both due to the overhead of
self-isolation (e.g., self-isolation periods every time I move) and
financial uncertainty (if I quit my current job, and later decide I
need to go back to working, my ability to find a new one may be
limited by the pandemic). Outside of changes that need to be made now
for compelling reasons, I prefer to defer major changes till after
COVID-19 is mostly under control around the world.

## How did writing this post help and what could I not do?

I prepared the [first draft of this
post](https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/commit/7ec8fa8a907a93f0e981b9afb04c09ebe0edf1bc)
on July 11, 2020, and since then have mostly let it sit around as a
draft, with minor tweaks. In the end of August, I reviewed the post
and added a few sections.

### This post led to the creation of the daily updates portal (updates.vipulnaik.com)

Drafting this post made me think more about organizing my daily
updates into a portal. A couple of weeks after the [first draft of
this post (July 10,
2020)](https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/commit/7ec8fa8a907a93f0e981b9afb04c09ebe0edf1bc),
I [made a series of commits on July 22 and July
23](https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/commits?since=2020-07-22&until=2020-07-23)
setting up the portal. I believe the idea of the portal had
crystallized in my mind the preceding weekend, because I had created
the subdomain DNS zone and installed the TLS certificate during that
weekend.

### I had to leave out many adjacent topics in this post because they may touch on work-related things

There were many related ideas I could have talked about, but that
would have been harder to opine on without sharing information about
my workplace that I think I shouldn't reveal. Topics include figuring
out exactly how much I should work, tradeoffs between working and
delegation in the workplace, tradeoffs between hiring for increased
redundancy versus seeking higher per-capita compensation. The reason
for my reticence isn't due to any juicy or highly secretive stuff at
work, but rather, the presumption of secrecy and confidentiality in
workplaces. So whereas for my personal projects, I start with a
presumption of public sharing that I then revise based on project
specifics, the workplace is the opposite: presumption of no sharing,
with exceptions needing to be explictly justified.

### I wasn't able to come up with a very logical organization of the post, so it's a loose aggregation of thoughts

I couldn't think of a neat logical structure within which to put my
observations. It's more a list of scattered thoughts. Perhaps with
more time, I would have been able to structure things better.

### I left out a lot of specifics, both qualitative and quantitative; this is both a plus and a minus

I could have written the post in a way that was colored much more with
actual examples of things I did, and actual (quantitative) numbers
that showed where exactly I was in particular trade-offs. I did not do
so, though I did link to the updates portal and finances portal, that
have some numbers.

The main reason (for writing the post the way I did) is that I was
approaching this post at a high level, and wanted to include ideas at
a general enough level that they didn't get bogged down by debates
about specifics. I think this may hurt the post by making some parts
of it too abstract and less fun, but it also keeps to a minimum some
distractions that more controversial and specific assertioins could
have created.
