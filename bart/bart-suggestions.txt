This question appeared in the BART fare survey, see bart.gov/faresurvey

I filled the survey on Saturday, April 8, 2017, and am mirroring my answer here

Q: Do you have any suggestions for other ways BART could raise revenue or reduce costs to balance its budget?

- Increase base fares for longer routes in the East Bay where there is little immediate transit competition. In particular, increase base fares more for stations that are reasonably close but not adjacent, particularly those that pass through the congested 12th st/19th st corridor. For instance, the fare from Ashby to West Oakland is just $1.95, the same as from Ashby to downtown Berkeley; the fare to West Oakland could and should be more.
- Increase the baseline trans-bay fare by a larger amount. As long as the fare remains comparable or even a little bit higher than the transbay bus fare, the fare should be competitive.
- Depending on feasibility, look into peak hour surcharges in fares. Peak hour surcharges could apply only to paper tickets, or to all tickets.
- Run shorter trains during the early morning, middle of the day, and late night.
- Reduce train frequency in the early morning and during the middle of the day.
