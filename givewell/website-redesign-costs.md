--- Begin email titled "Website expenses?" from Issa Rice to info@givewell.org, June 24, 2016 ---

Hi,

I was looking at the budget spreadsheet from December 2015: http://blog.givewell.org/files/GiveWell_budget_Dec_2015_(public).xlsx

I noticed under the category "Website" expenses of $75k in January, $77k in February, and $77k in May of 2015. If we account for the usual website expenses (say, $3k per month, as projected for 2016 and 2017, which is higher than the 2015 values), then this is about $220k for those three months over the usual website expenses.

I'm curious to know what these expenses were for. In particular, were they for the website redesigns for GiveWell and the Open Philanthropy Project, and if so, how are the expenses weighted for each website? I am also aware that the GiveWell website redesign has not been migrated onto the actual site yet; will there be additional expenses in the future for the actual migration?

I should also disclose that I am planning to write a blog post on the Effective Altruism Forum on GiveWell's budget information, and would appreciate if I could cite our correspondence in the post.

Thanks!

Issa

Hi Issa,

Thanks for your email. The budget expenses you point to ($225,000 total) were to a vendor to design and create the new Open Philanthropy website (now live at http://www.openphilanthropy.org/) and redesign the GiveWell website (which we have not yet launched). Half was for the Open Philanthropy site and half was for the GiveWell site. Good Ventures made a [grant](http://www.goodventures.org/our-portfolio/grants/givewell-open-philanthropy-project-website-construction) to GiveWell specifically to pay for half of the Open Philanthropy website.

We have been working with a developer to help us launch the GiveWell website so there have been and will continue to be some costs associated with that (though substantially less than the cost of the initial work).

Let me know if you have any other questions! You are welcome to cite this correspondence.

Best,
Natalie
