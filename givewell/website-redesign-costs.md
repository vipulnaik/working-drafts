Many of the links in this document were collated with help from Issa Rice. The document was also linked to from a [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/vipulnaik.r/posts/10210743203232119), that is mirrored [here](https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/givewell/website-redesign-costs-fb-post.txt).

Information we have on GiveWell/Open Phil website redesign/design: $100K+ each (with half of the $100K+ for Open Phil provided by Good Ventures through an explicit grant). This excludes ongoing $3K/month maintenance costs. Took 20 months for GiveWell and 12 months for Open Phil. It also excludes (I believe) GiveWell staff time spent monitoring the transition, for staff for whom this was not a primary job, though it is unclear how significant the staff time was.

* January 2015: [GiveWell — Open Philanthropy Project Website Construction](http://www.goodventures.org/our-portfolio/grants/givewell-open-philanthropy-project-website-construction) specifies a grant by Good Ventures to GiveWell of $56,250 for half the website design costs for the Open Philanthropy Project website.
* January 2015: Expenses of $75,000 reported on website, compared to usual $3,000 (see December 2015 budget).

General info on website design costs for nonprofits (all from Issa Rice, except the last one):

* <https://webcreate.com/blog/nonprofits>: "A typical website that presents the organization on about 20 pages, offers event registrations, processes online payments, and provides the organization with tools for easy, in-house content management costs in the range of $3,000-$6,000. That price range should include knowledge sharing from the web development firm and a facilitation of the entire process of getting online the right way."
* <http://web.archive.org/web/20160424014815/http://www.idealware.org/blog/2008/10/how-much-does-nonprofit-website-cost.html>: Lists $100K near upper bound, but note that the post is from 2008.
* <http://nonprofithub.org/nonprofit-web-design/nonprofit-website-investment-expense>: "There’s a huge difference in mentality and approach to decision-making when you’re focused on ROI as opposed to cost. I know nonprofit organizations that have spent literally $50,000 or more on their websites and had a huge return on investment because their donations increased, their fundraising capacity grew and some of their significant expenses decreased. I know other nonprofits that have spent $500 or less and ended up throwing their money away."
* <https://www.quora.com/How-much-do-nonprofit-organizations-budget-for-web-design/answer/Joe-Garecht>: "Large-Size non-profits will likely have a stand-along marketing budget, and will be willing to pay >$10,000 for a redesign, will likely want custom work, and will redesign more often, perhaps every 2-3 years." 
* <http://www.hewlett.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Hewlett-2015-Form-990-PF-full-return.pdf> (429 pages): Lots of examples of website redesign costs supported by the Hewlett Foundation. Costs range from $50,000 to $112,500 (there is a $17,000 cost listed for a website enhancement). Search for "website" in the (long) PDF.

## Email titled "Please respond by end of Monday: seeking your thoughts on new websites for GiveWell and Open Philanthropy Project" from Holden Karnofsky to an undisclosed list of recipients on February 6, 2015

Hi all,

We're in the midst of creating new websites for both GiveWell and the Open Philanthropy Project. We're potentially about to finalize the basic direction (look and feel, basic layout, etc.) and we would really appreciate your feedback before we do so. We're contacting you because we see you as a friend and/or fan of GiveWell whose opinion we value.

To view our draft website designs and give your feedback, please use this Google form:

<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PQi4fYX-KDolhYyrlDIe6JuSgGByMEcB4uHP73v2sGQ/viewform>

A few notes:
* We are only looking for high-level basic impressions. The goal here is to make sure we don't move forward with these websites unless we feel that our audience will be comfortable with them. We do not need detailed feedback.
* Please feel free to skip any and all questions except for the final couple of questions on each page, which ask for overall thoughts. Overall thoughts are what we're most interested in. If you just glance at these designs and send your big-picture impressions, that will be very helpful to us.
* We are on a tight schedule for completing the entire website, and we have agreed with our design firm that we are (a) probably only asking for feedback from outsiders once; (b) seeking to finish collecting feedback by the end of the day on Monday. So we would really appreciate your completing the survey by then.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to let me know. We really appreciate your help!

## Email titled "Website expenses?" from Issa Rice to info@givewell.org, June 24, 2016

Hi,

I was looking at the budget spreadsheet from December 2015: http://blog.givewell.org/files/GiveWell_budget_Dec_2015_(public).xlsx

I noticed under the category "Website" expenses of $75k in January, $77k in February, and $77k in May of 2015. If we account for the usual website expenses (say, $3k per month, as projected for 2016 and 2017, which is higher than the 2015 values), then this is about $220k for those three months over the usual website expenses.

I'm curious to know what these expenses were for. In particular, were they for the website redesigns for GiveWell and the Open Philanthropy Project, and if so, how are the expenses weighted for each website? I am also aware that the GiveWell website redesign has not been migrated onto the actual site yet; will there be additional expenses in the future for the actual migration?

I should also disclose that I am planning to write a blog post on the Effective Altruism Forum on GiveWell's budget information, and would appreciate if I could cite our correspondence in the post.

Thanks!

Issa

Hi Issa,

Thanks for your email. The budget expenses you point to ($225,000 total) were to a vendor to design and create the new Open Philanthropy website (now live at http://www.openphilanthropy.org/) and redesign the GiveWell website (which we have not yet launched). Half was for the Open Philanthropy site and half was for the GiveWell site. Good Ventures made a [grant](http://www.goodventures.org/our-portfolio/grants/givewell-open-philanthropy-project-website-construction) to GiveWell specifically to pay for half of the Open Philanthropy website.

We have been working with a developer to help us launch the GiveWell website so there have been and will continue to be some costs associated with that (though substantially less than the cost of the initial work).

Let me know if you have any other questions! You are welcome to cite this correspondence.

Best,
Natalie
