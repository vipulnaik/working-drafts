Some notes from November 2016 board meeting.

Begins with discussion of split. Alexander Berger did initial work, Sarah Ward now managing it as GiveWell Operations person. Said Alexander shouldn't be main person involved as he is moving to Open Phil.

GiveWell has hired a bunch of lawyers and is also in talks with a valuations firm to value the companies etc.

Elie clarifies he will continue to do Open Phil work even after the split, and will bill to Open Phil.

Post-split, hours will be cross-billed, and hours on both will be tracked.

Board members ignorant?

One of them didn't know the 2015 headline number of $110 million money moved, or that $70 million of it was from Good Ventures

One of them didn't know that GiveWell/Open Phil already separate staff on websites

Roughly 40 staff, 20 each for GiveWell and Open Phil. GiveWell staff includes administrative assistants who are at reception.

2 million dollars in projected spending for GiveWell, and 7 million for Open Phil. Roughly 50/50 staff split, Open Phil makes up the majority of expenditure.

Eventually Open Phil will get its own operations staff so GiveWell's existing operations staff will be focused mostly on GiveWell

Will GiveWell grow? Depends on extent to which they identify new giving opportunities and the role that staff growth plays in that.

Main kind of new employee GiveWell might have is people with experience evaluating empirical research. Don't know yet if they'll need such people, and how many (hire one, hire many, hire one who builds a team).
