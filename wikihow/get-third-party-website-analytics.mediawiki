This guide explore strategies for getting web traffic data for third-party websites, i.e., websites that are not owned and operated by you. The guide is helpful for providing benchmarks for your own website, in particular benchmarks for overall traffic levels, [[Understand Your Website Traffic Variation with Time|traffic variation with time]], and your [[Understand Your Website Audience Profile|audience profile]]. It can also be used to address the website-based method of [[Gauge the Popularity of a Topic Online|gauging the popularity of a topic online]].

=== Quantcast Measure ===
# Get data on the website, if available, at https://www.quantcast.com/<domainname>.
#* For instance, for the website Trello, with domain name trello.com, you can get data at https://www.quantcast.com/trello.com.<ref name=quantcast-trello>[https://www.quantcast.com/trello.com Quantcast data for Trello]. Retrieved April 26, 2017</ref> Similarly, for the website Glassdoor, with domain name glassdoor.com, you can get data at https://www.quantcast.com/glassdoor.com.<ref name=quantcast-glassdoor>[https://www.quantcast.com/glassdoor.com Quantcast data for Glassdoor]. Retrieved April 26, 2017</ref>
#* There are two kinds of websites: those that use Quantcast Measure (that Quantcast calls "quantified"), and those that do not. For websites that use Quantcast Measure, you will see the website name and a check mark in front of the name on top, and website traffic data below. For websites that do not use Quantcast Measure you will see a message on top of the form: "<website> is not currently using Quantcast Measure. As a result, we're unable to show you a full breakout of their audience data. If you own or work at <website> sign up for Quantcast Measure and place the measurement tag on your site to get all the audience insights detailed below."
#* For websites that ''do'' use Quantcast Measure, some sections of the traffic report may not be visible. There are two typical reasons for this: (a) the website owner has opted out of making that section of the traffic report visible, and (b) there is too little data to populate that section of the report. For each hidden part of the traffic report, a message explaining that the section is hidden, along with the reason, is displayed at the part of the page where the section would have shown up.
# Examine the various parts of the traffic report.
#* The first section of the traffic report is the traffic card, showing total uniques, views, and visits over a time range of your choosing, and at a granularity of day, week, or 30 day. Uniques are available only over time periods of a day, week, or 30 days. Data is available only from the point in time the website started using Quantcast Measure. Data is broken down as United States and non-United States. The timezone is chosen based on the place where the majority of traffic to the website comes from; for most websites that use Quantcast Measure, this is the United States, and the timezone is Mexico City's timezone (as that it close to the average of the various US timezones). The traffic numbers are based on direct, first-party measurement (using Quantcast's JavaScript installed on the website, that works in a similar way as Google Analytics). It therefore measures all traffic by users on browsers that can run JavaScript and are not using an ad blocker setting that blocks analytics tools.
#* The second section of the traffic report is the demographics card. This includes gender, age buckets, education level, and race. Unlike the traffic card, the demographics card is not based purely on direct measurement: it is based on a ''mix'' of measurement and extrapolation, where the demographic characteristics of each visitor are estimated based on a variety of visitor-specific signals. Quantcast uses seed data from a panel of users who have disclosed all the relevant demographic data abot themselves.
