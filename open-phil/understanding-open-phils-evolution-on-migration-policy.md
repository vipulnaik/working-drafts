# Understanding Open Philanthropy's evolution on migration policy

My co-blogger Sebastian wrote posts in
[2015](https://openborders.info/blog/overview-of-the-open-philanthropy-projects-work-on-migration-liberalisation/)
and
[2016](https://openborders.info/blog/update-open-philanthropy-projects-work-migration-liberalisation/)
reviewing Open Philanthropy's thinking and grantmaking work in the
migration space. It's now five years since the last post so I thought
it'd be worth revisiting the body of work.

This post is structured a bit differently than Sebastian's posts,
which went into detail on the individual grants. Since we now have a
larger set of grants (21 grants directly identified as being related
to migration policy) it's not that valuable to discuss them
individually, or even the ones made since Sebastian's last
post. Instead, the post focuses on Open Philanthropy's overall
strategy changes, how these changes are rooted in their broader
worldview and strategy, and the implications of these changes.

The post is structured as follows:

* Evidence that Open Philanthropy is reducing its involvement in and commitments to migration policy
* Factors influencing the reduced involvement
* Discussion of the implications, both in terms of what we can learn from Open Philanthropy and what it means for the crowdedness or lack thereof of the space

General links for reference:

* [Open Philanthropy's page on immigration policy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/immigration-policy)
* [Official Open Philanthropy immigration policy grant list](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/giving/grants?field_focus_area_target_id_selective=90) -- this should update as more grants are added.
* [Donaations List Website (DLW) page on Open Philanthropy's migration policy grants](https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donor.php?donor=Open+Philanthropy&cause_area_filter=Migration+policy): DLW is a website I manage that includes information on donations by various entities I track. As of the time of writing this post, DLW is up-to-date on Open Philanthropy's migration policy grantmaking, but not on their grantmaking in some other areas including scientific research and criminal justice reform. I expect to continue to update the page but it may be lagged somewhat from the official list.

## Evidence that Open Philanthropy is reducing its involvement in and commitments to migration policy

### Implicit evidence from the pattern of grantmaking

A few lines of evidence are suggestive:

* The grants database includes *no* grants since November 2020 -- a
  gap of almost a year as of the time of writing this post. There's
  usually a lag of a few months between making a grant and publishing
  a write-up about it, so this absence could still be consistent with
  *some* grantmaking in 2021, but likely not much.

* Open Philanthropy has been using [exit
  grants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_grant) as well as
  reducing levels of commitment even for grantees that they are
  continuing to support.

  * The [March 2020
    grant](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/immigration-policy/center-global-development-migration-program-2020)
    to the Center for Global Development for the migration program
    (led by Michael Clemens) appears to reduce ongoing support for the
    program from the $600,000/year for the previous grant to a
    funding level of $200,000/year (after one year at the old
    funding level) that "may be more sustainable for the long run."
  
  * They exit-granted Labor Mobility Partnerships in [November
    2020](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/immigration-policy/labor-mobility-partnerships-international-labor-mobility)
    and Niskanen Center in [January
    2020](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/immigration-policy/niskanen-center-research-on-immigration-policy-2020).

  * They had previously exit-granted [Protect the
    People](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/immigration-policy/protect-people-exit-grant)
    back in 2016, though that exit grant was tied more to providing
    initial philanthropic funding to a project whose goal was to be
    sustainable. More details on Open Philanthropy's learnings from
    the program are
    [here](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/immigration-policy/october-2017-update-protect-people-seasonal-migration-haiti).

A counterpoint is a [raw look at the
numbers](https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donor.php?donor=Open+Philanthropy&cause_area_filter=Migration+policy#donorDonationAmountsByDoneeAndYear)
which actually shows 2020 as the *biggest year* in terms of money
donated for migration policy (at $3.7 million donated). That number
alone is misleading because grants often have multi-year timeframes,
and depending on when the first grant was made and what the
periodicity is, the grants can sometimes bunch up in a year. Indeed,
this was the case for 2020:

* The [March 2020
  grant](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/immigration-policy/center-global-development-migration-program-2020)
  to the Center for Global Development happened at the end of the
  three-year timeframe of the previous [March 2017
  grant](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/immigration-policy/center-global-development-migration-program). The
  amount of the March 2020 grant was *less* than that of the
  previous March 2017 grant, as discussed above.

* The [January 2020 exit
  grant](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/immigration-policy/niskanen-center-research-on-immigration-policy-2020)
  to Niskanen Center was at the end of the two-year timeframe of the
  previous [January 2018
  grant](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/immigration-policy/niskanen-immigration-2018). The
  amount was also half -- reflecting a shorter period of support,
  but the same rate per year.

* The [August 2020 exit
  grant](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/immigration-policy/labor-mobility-partnerships-international-labor-mobility)
  to Labor Mobility Partnersips was a little before the end of the
  1.5-year timeframe of the previous 1.5-year [March 2019 incubation
  grant](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/immigration-policy/center-global-development-labor-mobility-partnerships). The
  amount was also corresponding lower but at roughly the same rate
  per year.

Based on giving in 2020, the two main programs that Open Philanthropy
seems interested in continuing to support on an ongoing basis are the
Center for Global Development migration program (at $200,000/year)
and the International Refugee Assistance Project general support (at
$500,000/year).

One positive sign of increased giving was a grant to Mercy Corps for
seasonal migration in Nigeria. Open Philanthropy has previously funded
studies of migration around the world, and this seems in line with
that past funding -- but the magnitude of the Mercy Corps funding is
significant at $1,000,000. It is unclear, however, if this was a
one-off, and moreover, this is a bit outside what we normally think of
as migration *policy* (as the barriers being addressed when promoting
seasonal migration are more financial and educational than policy
restrictions).

### Explicit statements from Open Philanthropy

I could not find a lot of public discussion by Open Philanthropy of
strategy changes tied to funding specifically in the migration policy
space. However, grantmaking in migration policy is mentioned in their
annual progress reports. These reports make clear that Open
Philanthropy is interested in continuing to maintain support at
relatively low levels in this cause area for now. What they *don't*
make clear is whether there are any changes to the relative importance
over the years.

The [2017 progress / 2018 plans post](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/our-progress-2017-and-plans-2018) says:

> By default, we plan to continue with our relatively low level of effort and resources in other focus areas (e.g., macroeconomic stabilization policy, or “other” global catastrophic risks).

Although migration policy is not listed here, it is implicit, as becomes clear from the evaluation in the [2018 progress / 2019 plans post](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/our-progress-2018-and-plans-2019) post:

> We also wrote:
>
> > By default, we plan to continue with our relatively low level of effort and resources in other focus areas (e.g., macroeconomic stabilization policy, or “other” global catastrophic risks).
>
> Other grants included the Center for Popular Democracy and the Economic Policy Institute (macroeconomic stabilization policy), the International Refugee Assistance Project (immigration reform), and California YIMBY (land use reform).

The 2018 progress / 2019 plans post sets a similar goal for 2019:

> By default, we plan to continue with our relatively low level of focus and resource deployment in other areas (e.g., macroeconomic stabilization policy).

The [2019 progress / 2020 plans post](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/our-progress-2019-and-plans-2020) confirms this:

> We also wrote:
>
> > By default, we plan to continue with our relatively low level of focus and resource deployment in other areas (e.g., macroeconomic stabilization policy).
>
> Other grants included the Center for Global Development (Global Health and Development), California YIMBY (Land Use Reform), the International Refugee Assistance (Immigration Policy), Employ America (Macroeconomic Stabilization Policy), and the Center for Election Science (other).

The 2019 progress / 2020 plans post sets a similar goal for 2020:

> By default, we plan to continue with our relatively low level of focus and resource deployment in other areas (e.g., macroeconomic stabilization policy).

The [2020 progress / 2021 plans](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/our-progress-2020-and-plans-2021) confirms this:

> We also wrote:
>
> By default, we plan to continue with our relatively low level of focus and resource deployment in other areas (e.g., macroeconomic stabilization policy).
>
> Our giving in causes beyond those listed above remained at comparatively low levels. Grants in these areas included the Center for Global Development (Immigration Policy), Employ America (Macroeconomic Stabilization Policy), Mercy Corps (Immigration Policy), the International Refugee Assistance Project (Immigration Policy), and YIMBY Law (Land Use Reform).

And it says the same for 2021:

> By default, we plan to continue with our relatively low level of grantmaking in other areas (e.g., macroeconomic stabilization policy).

### How the evolution of grantmaking in migration policy compares with other cause areas

Certain cause areas have been prioritized by Open Philanthropy; this
prioritization can be seen in the annual progress reports and is also
reflected when we look at the pattern of grantmaking. Example areas include [AI safety](https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donor.php?donor=Open+Philanthropy&cause_area_filter=AI+safety), [animal welfare](https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donor.php?donor=Open+Philanthropy&cause_area_filter=Animal+welfare), and [biosecurity and pandemic preparedness](https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donor.php?donor=Open+Philanthropy&cause_area_filter=Biosecurity+and+pandemic+preparedness). Some indicators of continued focus in these areas include:

* At least a few grants in 2021.
* Large amount of annual grantmaking (at least several million a year).
* Diversity of grantees (large numbers of distinct grantees).
* Identification as a high-priority area in blog posts and public materials.

Migration policy clearly isn't in league with these. But perhaps it's
better to compare migration policy with other areas that are more
structurally similar: [land use
reform](https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donor.php?donor=Open+Philanthropy&cause_area_filter=Land+use+reform)
and [macreconomic stabilization
policy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/giving/grants?field_focus_area_target_id_selective=91). Here
is what the comparison indicates:

* All three areas get a similar treatment in Open Philanthropy's
  annual progress / plans report.

* Migration policy has slightly higher overall spend across the
  years, the dubious distinction of a lot of exit grants, which is
  more evidence of Open Philanthropy scaling back in the area.

* Land use reform, like migration policy, has had a relatively quiet
  last couple of years; although the amount donated hasn't fallen
  much, the diversity of organizations receiving grants in recent
  years has reduced. However, it doesn't seem to have had explicitly
  announced exit grants, and one of the factors causing infrequent
  granting is the long timeframes for grants (meaning less frequent
  renewal). So there isn't that much change to the number of
  organizations being supported if you consider whether they are
  stilll within the timeframe of a previous grant. The [graphic
  here](https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donor.php?donor=Open+Philanthropy&cause_area_filter=Land+use+reform#donorDonationList)
  helps visualize this.

* Macroeconomic stabilization policy, relatively speaking, is teeming
  with activity in terms of diversity of grantees.

My overall assessment is that migration policy is pretty comparable
with land use reform, though with slight pattern
differences. Macroeconomic stabilization policy is a little ahead
right now.

## Factors influencing the reduced involvement

When Open Philanthropy published its [Labor Mobility cause
report](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/labor-mobility)
back in May 2013, it considered the area to have high
potential. Similar cause reports were published for other areas. Over
time, some of these areas "took off" with Open Phil deciding to spend
much more on them, and others, such as migration policy and land use
reform, continued at maintenance levels. What happened in the
intervening years that affected this? Let's understand a bit about how
Open Phil evaluates causes, and then look both at how their general
thinking has evolved and their specific learnings in the migration
policy space.

### Importance, neglectedness, and tractability and BOTECs

Open Phil follows a framework similar to the framework of importance,
neglecetdness, and tractability: they want to pick *important* causes
that have been *neglected* by other funders and are *tractable*.

The initial cause report established migration policy as important but
was ambivalent about the questions of neglectedness and
tractability. Over the years, Open Phil has acquired more evidence on
neglectedness and tractability -- particularly tractability of the
kinds of areas where money can move things forward.

[One of the practices](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/questions-we-ask-ourselves-making-grant#Evaluating_a_grant8217s_cost-effectiveness) followed commonly in Open Philanthropy's internal
grant writeups is that of BOTECs (back-of-the-envelope-calculations)
that roughly estimate the cost-effecttiveness of a grant. BOTECs incorporate the ideas of importance, neglectedness, and tractability all into a single formula.

In addition, beyond individual grants, Open Philanthropy uses similar
cost-effectiveness calculations to inform how much to focus on
particular cause areas.

### Evolution of the "bar" for grants

In thinking about different buckets of money allocation, Open
Philanthropy separates long-termist grantmaking from near-termist
grantmaking (recently renamed [global health and
wellbeing](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/open-philanthropy-s-new-co-ceo)),
and further separates human-centric grantmaking from animal-centric
grantmaking. The "near-termist, human-centric" group of grants
includes several areas such as global health and development,
scientific research, immigration policy, land use reform, and
macroeconomic stabilization policy.

One key evolution in Open Philanthropy's thinking, particularly as it
applies to near-termist, human-centric grantmaking, is in the "bar"
that grants must satisfy in terms of the cost-effectiveness multiplier
expected. This evolution is described in deetail in the 2019 blog post
[GiveWell’s Top Charities Are (Increasingly) Hard to
Beat](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/givewells-top-charities-are-increasingly-hard-beat). As
the blog post describes, Open Philanthropy's original bar for
cost-effectiveeness was that it should beat out the 100x multiplier
expected for unconditional cash transfers. However, by the time of the
2019 blog post, Open Philanthropy is considering a bar of 500-1,500x,
comparable with GiveWell top charities.

The raising of the bar is a reflection of greater confidence in the
cost-effectiveness estimates underlying GiveWell's top charity
selection, as well as more confidence that there is enough room for
more funding for these charities to use up. In a review of [past
BOTECs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GsE2_TNWn0x6MWL1PTdkZT2vQNFW8VFBslC5qjk4sgo/edit),
this led to the conclusion that out of 33 grants whose internal
writeups including *ex ante* BOTECs, all passed the original 100x bar
but onlly 8 of the 33 passed the 1000x bar.

A predicted consequence of this raising of the bar would be a
reduction in grantmaking in near-termist, human-centric areas
including criminal justice reform, migration policy, land use reform,
and macroeconomic stabilization policy. However, the blog post
disavows any immediate major changes to grantmaking patterns:

> We are still in the process of thinking through the implications of
> these claims, and we are not planning any rapid changes to our
> grantmaking at this time. We currently plan to continue making
> grants in our current focus areas at approximately the same level as

### Specific learning by Open Philanthropy about migration

Combining information gleaned from various grant write-ups, the
following are some learnings Open Philanthropy appears to have
acquired about the migration space:

* They have become a bit more bullish on refugee migration. Here's a
  blurb found on a few recent refugee migration grants such as the
  [2019 IRAP
  grant](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/immigration-policy/international-refugee-assistance-project-general-support-2019):

  > In the past, our immigration policy work has not focused much on
  > refugee resettlement, which we had assumed would be more crowded
  > than other aspects of immigration policy with funders aimed at
  > supporting increased opportunities for people to move to the
  > U.S. for humanitarian reasons. While we continue to believe that
  > is directionally correct, our increased interest in supporting
  > advocacy around refugee resettlement is partially based on
  > learning more about the fairly limited foundation funding for
  > advocacy around refugee resettlement.

  The largest ongoing commitment seems to be support for IRAP at a
  rate of $500,000/year.

* They have struggled to find success in the space of influencing
  policy around labor mobility or migration more generally. They've
  exited the space in various ways, including exiting Niskanen Center,
  exitig Labor Mobility Partnerships after helping start it, and
  reducing ongoing commitment to the Center for Global Development's
  migration program to $200,000/year.

* Their efforts to fund programs that directly support worker visas
  (such as grants to the U.S. Association for International Migration
  and Protect the People for Haiti H-2A visas) didn't give the desired
  magnitude of results but might have succeeded in creating low-level
  sustainable flows.

## Discussion of the implications, both in terms of what we can learn from Open Philanthropy and what it means for the crowdedness or lack thereof of the space

### Open Philanthropy's reasons for not focusing on migration policy are related to tractability

As best as I can make out, Open Philanthropy has not significantly
changed its thinking on the importance of the issue or its
neglectedness (with the exception of refugee migration where it has
updated toward that area being more negleceted). Rather, the biggest
updates have been around tractability (where there was initially a lot
of uncertainty). To break that down further, this is talking about the
tractability of what Open Philanthropy and its grantees can
accomplish, and not the tractability of what they could accomplish if
they had the ability to directly write migration policies.

One important multiplier that significantly diminished tractability is
the uncertainty of pushing desired changes through political
systems. This applies particularly to political advocacy, think tank
work, etc.

Another factor affecting tractability is that individual programs to
navigate complex systems, such as the H-2A use by Haiti, can suffer
from program design challenges and limitations. New patterns of
migration tend to start slowly and grow over time, which also makes
the evaluation of programs to push for these more complicated.

Neither of these reasons has *much* effect on our estimate of the
value of changing migration policies themselves. It's more about Open
Philanthropy's relative lack of power in affecting those changes.

### This is an update of sorts against migration philanthropy for donors with a similar quantitative focus

Open Philanthropy is well-funded and has devoted a fair amount of time
and energy to exploring possibilities in migration philanthropy. If
they have not found strong opportunities for migration philanthropy,
that suggests that such options are probably either not available or
hard to find. So while this shouldn't change our view on the moral
justness or practical consequences of immigration restrictions, it
should make us more pessimistic about tthe ability of philanthropy to
meaningfully move this. For donors who are moderately cause-agnostic,
it does look like, relative to other causes, migration policy may not
be the right thing to focus on.

### There is space for other donors passionate about migration policy to make donations

Even if we update against migration policy from a purely
cost-effectiveness angle, there's still plenty of room to donate in
the space.

Open Philanthropy has transformed spaces like animal welfare and AI
safety by pumping huge amounts of money into these spaces.
