Three different axes:

Exploratory versus linear impact

Direct versus indirect impact

Mainstream versus neglected

Claim 1: We should favor linear impact over exploratory impact

Claim 2: Any exploratory impact should be with eye to short-term convertibiility to linear impact

Claim 3: Indirect linear impacts can be pretty respectable and aren't that much worse than direct linear impact

Claim 4: Generate auxiliary linear impacts from exploration where possible

In other words, nonlinearity and indirectness carry comparable penalties


Exploratory impact and the charlatn
