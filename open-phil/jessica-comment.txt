When I had originally read Jessica's post I was quite sympathetic to it. However, more recent experience has changed my views. Specifically, seeing a post like http://effective-altruism.com/ea/17o/some_thoughts_on_public_discourse/ from an intellectual elite with a wide following making a bunch of claims I took strong issue with, I found myself on the opposite side of the issue. This elite individual (Holden Karnofsky) has a large number of people who read and respect him, and many others who will give his views serious weight and deference. When he opines on a topic, however offhandedly, that gives a strong leg up to his views. The same is true of people like Jessica Livingston and others at Y Combinator like Paul Graham and Sam Altman; random, off-the-cuff essays, thoughts, and tweets by them would get shared thousands of times on social media, and change the minds of loads of people. These folks have a lot of power, and the way they can wield that power (intentionally or carelessly) to push specific viewpoints concerns me.

How do we come up with an incentive structure that disincentivizes powerful people like them from misusing their power? Holding each of their statements, even casual ones, to high critical standards, seems to be the only viable approach I am aware of. Otherwise, it's not a level playing field: the powerful have a huge audience that takes them at their word by default. If you're powerful and influential, you shouldn't have it both ways (be able to influence through casual statements and yet not be held responsible for them).

Does this make powerful people somewhat reluctant to share valuable insights? Yes. But I'd say that on net, (a) powerful people still have a much easier time than others having their insights taken seriously by others, even controlling for the quality of the insight, (b) I'd prefer self-censoring mechanisms that force them to select their most defensible, robust statements and beliefs and cut out the things that they know won't stand scrutiny.
