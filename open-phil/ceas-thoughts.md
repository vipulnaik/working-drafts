Thought dump:

I'm writing of writing a blog post on the EA Forum discussing the Committee for Effective Altruism Support

Open Phil's own hope: """We hope the committee structure described here will lead to better allocations within this set of grantees, and that our explanation of our limitations and rationale will lead to a clearer understanding of our actions by other donors and stakeholders."""

Positives:

- Better decision-making through larger number of inputs and more robust discussion
- It's good that they disclose for each grant whether CEAS was used to decide the grant amount

Negatives:

- The "set budget" allocation aspect suggests that a fixed budget is being allocated between "EA orgs". This suggests competition for resources between the orgs. But how does this even work unless all the grants are decided at the same time?
- The relation between this process and the other constraints in Open Phil grantmaking (e.g., not funding over 50% of an org's budget) are unclear. Is each committee member's votes tied by that constraint? Or is just the overall amount finally allocated tied by that constraint?

Negatives in terms of lack of knowledge in general:
- The set of EA orgs is unknown/unclear, until an actual grant is made to one using the committee
- It's not clear what role CEAS has in deciding whether to make the grant at all, or whether they're looped in only after the grant decision is made and the amount needs to be tweaked.
- Identity of committee members unknown, making it less clear how to interpret the numbers. We don't have a clear idea on the community members outside of Open Phil at all

Negatives in terms of lack of knowledge for individual grants:
- Vote distribution unknown. Vote distribution can be important in informing individual donors who have different risk-taking propensities
- Empirically, the two recent grants decided by CEAS have way shorter grant descriptions than similar grants made to those same organizations prior to CEAS. This suggests that, going forward, the grants made by CEAS will have less public information on reasoning. Also consistent with the idea that because it's a result of committee discussion it's harder to provide a unified voice explaining the decision
