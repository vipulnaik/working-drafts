I have a few questions regarding payment logistics.

(1) I see that for some payments,  it is explicitly specified that the funder is Good Ventures, or Cari Tuna. Are all grants where the funder is not specified funded through the Open Philanthropy Project LLC?

(2) For some grants, it is said that the grant is "over <some number of> years". Does that mean that the grant is disbursed in annual installments for that many years, and are all the installments the same size? And for grants where no such thing is specified, does that mean all the grant money is disbursed at once?
