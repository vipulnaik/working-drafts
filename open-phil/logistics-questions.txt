I have a few questions regarding payment logistics.

(1) I see that for some payments,  it is explicitly specified that the funder is Good Ventures, or Cari Tuna (https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/openai-general-support for the latter). Are all grants where the funder is not specified funded through the Open Philanthropy Project Fund, as described at https://www.openphilanthropy.org/giving/guide-for-grant-seekers? Also, one of the potential funding sources is specified as the Open Philanthropy Action Fund, but Googling it on your site does not turn up any grants where it is explicitly stated that the grant is made through that fund. Has that fund never been used for any donations published so far?

(2) For some grants such as https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/openai-general-support it is said that the grant is "over <some number of> years". Does that mean that the grant is disbursed in annual installments for that many years, and are all the installments the same size? And for grants where no such thing is specified, does that mean all the grant money is disbursed at once?

(3) You sometimes refer to grants, particularly those made to universities, as gifts, e.g., https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/ucla-artificial-intelligence-governance Is there any special meaning to the use of "gift", or is that simply mirroring the language typically used by the grantee (since universities often refer to money sent to them as gifts)?
