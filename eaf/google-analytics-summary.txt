<p>As 2016 comes to a close, I thought it'd be interesting to look at traffic trends on the Effective Altruism Forum since its launch around September 7, 2014. Some key takeaways follow, after which I discuss more of the data.</p>

<h3>Key takeaways</h3>

<ul>
<li>Annual cycle and long-term growth trends:<ul>
<li>December and January see the highest traffic in the year, as expected considering it is Giving Season (though the relative role of demand for content and supply of content is unclear). The summer months see the lowest traffic. This seasonal fluctuation is more significant than year-over-year growth.</li>
<li>Overall, year-over-year growth in total pageviews has been negligible (between 0% and 10% per year) and swamped by other sources of fluctuation (so for a given month it could even be negative, and for some months it could be as high as 30%). From late 2014 to late 2015, there was a significant increase in sessions accompanied by a decrease in pages/session that roughly canceled. In 2016, sessions and pages/session have remained roughly constant. (<a href="#negligible-year-over-year-growth">more</a>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Impact of EA events: EA Global and other similar events have negligible traffic impact, even short-run trafic impact.</li>
<li>Post traffic lifecycle (norm and exceptions):<ul>
<li>The majority of posts get almost all their traffic in the first few days after they are published. The traffic may come from social media and other referrals, or people discovering the content from the home page.</li>
<li>A few pieces of content get sustained traffic over a long period of time, and one piece of content sees a big traffic increase every Giving Season. Half of these pieces are EA classics, the other half are about tangentially related subjects of wider interest.</li>
</ul></li></ul>

<h3 id="annual-cycle-and-long-term-growth-trends">Annual cycle and long-term growth trends</h3>

<p>Here's a graph of monthly pageviews in Google Analytics. Note that since the site was launched after a few days of September 2014 were already over, the September 2014 number represents a period shorter than a month.</p>

<p>You can see that December and January have higher traffic than the surrounding months in 2014. In 2015, February actually has slightly higher traffic than January, but you can still see the same qualitative picture: a sharp rise in traffic in December, a decline in January, and a return to normalcy soon. For the 2016 end-of-year Giving Season, we only have December data, and we see a pretty huge rise from November to December.</P.

<p>As you can see from the picture, overall year-over-year growth has been negligible, with random fluctuation and annual variation playing a bigger role. For instance, in September 2014 (the month of launch, where a few days were missing since those were pre-launch), there were 26,256 pageviews. The corresponding numbers in September 2015 and September 2016 were 30,467 (+16.0% year-over-year) and 26,347 (-14.5% year-over-year). For October, the numbers in 2014, 2015, and 2016 were respectively 25,237, 26,259 (+4.0% year-over-year), and 32,880 (+25.2% year-over-year).</p>

<p>With that said, there is clearer evidence of year-over-year growth for November and December. As a result, the gap between Giving Season and other months has been increasing from 2014 to 2015 to 2016.</p>

<p>Data is very limited but one tentative theory that fits the evidence so far is that the growth of the EA movement has been strongest people whose interest in EAF content is high only during Giving Season. Another is that content creators are focusing their content creation and publishing efforts more during Giving Season and less during other months, and this is increasing the traffic difference between Giving Season and other months.</p>

<p>One interesting trend between late 2014 and late 2015: although the increase in number of pageviews was small, sessions increased quite a bit. Pages/session dropped to compensate. This could be because people began using EAF more on their phones (thus increasing the number of sessions and users recorded by GA). It could be because the number of people accessing EAF increased, but the interest and dedication of the early adopters declined.</p>

<p>The vast majority of EAF posts get the vast majority of their traffic within a few days of publication. Typical examples: </p>

<p>However, the top viewed items of all time display a different pattern: although they do have more views around the time of initial publication, they continue to receive a steady stream of views. Below is a list of the top viewed articles of all time, with qualitative explanations of their view pattern:</p>
