<p>As 2016 comes to a close, I thought it'd be interesting to look at traffic trends on the Effective Altruism Forum since its launch around September 7, 2014. Some key takeaways follow, after which I discuss more of the data.</p>

<h3>Key takeaways</h3>

<ul>
<li>Annual cycle and long-term growth trends:<ul>
<li>December and January see the highest traffic in the year, as expected considering it is Giving Season (though the relative role of demand for content and supply of content is unclear). The summer months see the lowest traffic. This seasonal fluctuation is more significant than year-over-year growth.</li>
<li>Overall, year-over-year growth in total pageviews has been negligible (about 10% per year) and swamped by other sources of fluctuation (so for a given month it could even be negative, and for some months it could be as high as 30%). From late 2014 to late 2015, there was a significant increase in sessions accompanied by a decrease in pages/session that roughly canceled. In 2016, sessions and pages/session have remained roughly constant. (<a href="#negligible-year-over-year-growth">more</a>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Impact of EA events: EA Global and other similar events have negligible traffic impact, even short-run trafic impact.</li>
<li>Post traffic lifecycle (norm and exceptions):<ul>
<li>The majority of posts get almost all their traffic in the first few days after they are published. The traffic may come from social media and other referrals, or people discovering the content from the home page.</li>
<li>A few pieces of content get sustained traffic over a long period of time. This could be steady traffic or traffic resulting from multiple traffic spikes. Some of these pieces are generic EA classics, and others are about tangentially related subjects of wider interest. No articles exclusively about EA organizations or personal donation decisions have made it to this list.</li>
</ul></li></ul>

<h3 id="annual-cycle-and-long-term-growth-trends">Annual cycle and long-term growth trends</h3>

<p>Here's a graph of monthly pageviews in Google Analytics. Note that since the site was launched after a few days of September 2014 were already over, the September 2014 number represents a period shorter than a month.</p>

<p>You can see that December and January have higher traffic than the surrounding months in 2014. In 2015, February actually has slightly higher traffic than January, but you can still see the same qualitative picture: a sharp rise in traffic in December, a decline in January, and a return to normalcy soon. For the 2016 end-of-year Giving Season, we only have December data, and we see a pretty huge rise from November to December.</p>

<p>An year-over-year comparison between EAF's first year (September 7, 2014 to September 6, 2015, compared with September 7, 2015 to September 6, 2016) shows a 9.86% increase in pageviews (from 314,789 to 345,832), a 21.53% increase in sessions, and a 26.97% increase in users. Pages/session and average session duration fell.</p>

<p>Looking at some specific months shows how noise overwhelms this slight long-term increase. For instance, in September 2014 (the month of launch, where a few days were missing since those were pre-launch), there were 26,256 pageviews. The corresponding numbers in September 2015 and September 2016 were 30,467 (+16.0% year-over-year) and 26,347 (-14.5% year-over-year). For October, the numbers in 2014, 2015, and 2016 were respectively 25,237, 26,259 (+4.0% year-over-year), and 32,880 (+25.2% year-over-year).</p>

<p>With that said, there is clearer evidence of year-over-year growth for November and December. As a result, the gap between Giving Season and other months has been increasing from 2014 to 2015 to 2016.</p>

<p>Data is very limited but one tentative theory that fits the evidence so far is that the growth of the EA movement has been strongest people whose interest in EAF content is high only during Giving Season. Another is that content creators are focusing their content creation and publishing efforts more during Giving Season and less during other months, and this is increasing the traffic difference between Giving Season and other months.</p>

<p>One interesting trend between late 2014 and late 2015: although the increase in number of pageviews was small, sessions increased quite a bit. Pages/session dropped to compensate. This could be because people began using EAF more on their phones (thus increasing the number of sessions and users recorded by GA). It could be because the number of people accessing EAF increased, but the interest and dedication of the early adopters declined.</p>

<h3 id="impact-of-ea-events">Impact of EA events</h3>

<p>The main story regarding EA events is the non-story: there is no increase in traffic to EAF in or around EA Global or major events.</p>

<h3 id="post-traffic-lifecycle-norms-and-exceptions">Post traffic lifecycle: norms and exceptions</a>

<p>The vast majority of EAF posts get the vast majority of their traffic within a few days of publication. Typical examples:</p>

<p>However, the top viewed items of all time display a different pattern: although they do have more views around the time of initial publication, they continue to receive a steady stream of views long after they are published. Below is a list of the five top viewed articles of all time, with qualitative explanations of their view pattern:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/6x/introduction_to_effective_altruism/">Introduction to Effective Altruism</a>, averaged about 50 pageviews a day from mid-2015 to August 2016, and then dropped to about 10 pageviews a day ((probably due to competition from <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/">Introduction to Effective Altruism on effectivealtruism.org</a>).</li>
<li><a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/6u/the_drowning_child_and_the_expanding_circle/">The Drowning Child and the Expanding Circle</a> sees traffic in waves, with sudden spikes after some sort of media publicity and then gradual decay over time, till the next spike.</li>
<li><a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/45/what_is_effective_altruism/">What is Effective Altruism?</a> had a traffic spike in July 2015, after which it saw 20 pageviews a day for a while. The number has decayed gradually and is now about 5 a day. <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=what%20is%20effective%20altruism">Search query competition</a> could explain the decline. https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#report/content-pages/a53416835w86109361p89329676/%3F_u.date00%3D20140901%26_u.date01%3D20161231%26_r.drilldown%3Danalytics.pagePath%3A%2Fea%2F45%2Fwhat_is_effective_altruism%2F%26explorer-graphOptions.selected%3Danalytics.nthDay%26explorer-table.plotKeys%3D%5B%5D/ </li>
<li><a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/5e/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/">Efficient charity: do unto others...</a> spiked in late January 2016, and has since fluctuated, averaging between 2 and 15 pageviews a day. https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#report/content-pages/a53416835w86109361p89329676/%3F_u.date00%3D20140901%26_u.date01%3D20161231%26_r.drilldown%3Danalytics.pagePath%3A%2Fea%2F5e%2Fefficient_charity_do_unto_others%2F%26explorer-graphOptions.selected%3Danalytics.nthDay%26explorer-table.plotKeys%3D%5B%5D/ </li>
<li><a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/c8/should_you_donate_to_the_wikimedia_foundation/">Should you donate to the Wikimedia Foundation?</a> had three spikes: one at the time of initial writing (in late March 2015), and two more during the Giving Seasons of 2015 and 2016, coinciding with the Wikimedia Foundation fundraisers through Wikipedia banners. Disclosure: I wrote this post, and have spent some time understanding its view statistics.  https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#report/content-pages/a53416835w86109361p89329676/%3F_u.date00%3D20140901%26_u.date01%3D20161231%26_r.drilldown%3Danalytics.pagePath%3A%2Fea%2Fc8%2Fshould_you_donate_to_the_wikimedia_foundation%2F%26explorer-graphOptions.selected%3Danalytics.nthDay%26explorer-table.plotKeys%3D%5B%5D/ </li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond the top five, the picture becomes more mixed. The sixth and seventh article, namely  <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/x4/philosophical_critiques_of_effective_altruism_by/">Philosophical Critiques of Effective Altruism by Prof Jeff McMahan</a> and <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/4r/cheerfully/">Cheerfully</a>, had only one spike at time of publication, but do still get a very slow but still steady trickle of traffic. In eighth place is the wide-interest article <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/fh/six_ways_to_get_along_with_people_who_are_totally/">Six Ways To Get Along With People Who Are Totally Wrong*</a>. This has had three big spikes and a much much smaller steady stream of articles. In ninth position is <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/12z/concerns_with_intentional_insights/">Concerns with Intentional Insights</a>, which has had only one huge and short-lived spike, but given its recency, it could have more spikes later.</p>
