# What regrets have you had regarding past donations?

I've been thinking about the question of whether and how much to
donate, compared to other uses of money (including saving for
later). These thoughts prompted an [earlier
post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4R5f4ntM6t3GLoLTw/donor-strategies-for-separating-how-much-from-where-to)
where I tried separating the "how much" and "where" to donate
questions. More recently, I wrote a post on [levels of
donation](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/F4DxPrfmnEtEwhPJu/levels-of-donation)
to clarify the different strategies I might follow as a donor
depending on how much I donate.

One useful prompt for thinking about many questions is based on the
[anticipated regret
framing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regret_(decision_theory)). In
this case, it would translate to: what kinds of donations tend to lead
to regret, and what kinds of regrets? I'm curious about the ways that
people have regretted their past donations, and how such past regret
has informed their future donations. Please share your thoughts in the
comments!

A few examples of the kind of regret that I can imagine possible:

1. You regret that your donation was either ineffective or actively
   harmful (because you reversed your mind either on the cause area or
   on the specific organization you donated to). See, for instance, [Brian Tomasik](https://reducing-suffering.org/my-donations-past-and-present/):  

   > I donated to several different organizations in the past, some of
   > which I still support and some of which I now oppose.

   In [this
   post](https://blog.givewell.org/2007/01/27/the-three-fs-food-friendz-and-figuring-out-how-to-improve-the-world/)
   Holden Karnofsky doesn't directly express regret, but his
   observations are the sort that might trigger regret in some people.

2. You've found much better donation opportunities since then, and
   you're sad that you can't direct as much money as you'd like to these
   better donation opportunities because you gave too much to what you
   now think of as an inferior donation opportunity.
3. The total money you donated left you with less money for personal
   use (such as dealing with a personal emergency, a great investment
   opportunity that would make you more money that you could donate,
   or a personal life change such as getting married and having kids).
4. The total money you donated left you with less money for pursuing
   altruistic ventures, such as starting your own nonprofit, taking up
   a job at a nonprofit that pays less, or helping other people start
   their own nonprofit or engage in an altruistic venture.
