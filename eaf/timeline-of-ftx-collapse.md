# Timeline of FTX collapse

Sebastian Sanchez has been working on a [timeline of FTX
collapse](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_FTX_collapse)
on the Timelines Wiki; I'm paying for the work and also providing some
input and direction. The timeline isn't quite done yet; you can see
some pending (unchecked) items in the [What the timeline is still
missing
section](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_FTX_collapse#What_the_timeline_is_still_missing). And
we may need to expand it further as we find more information or new
stuff happens. Further proofreading and fact-checking are also pending.

The timeline is focused largely on the collapse in November 2022;
Sebastian plans to work on a [timeline of
FTX](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_FTX) that will go
more into the background. For more on what the collapse timeline is focused on, see the [inclusion criteria section of the timeline](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_FTX_collapse#Inclusion_criteria).

Thoughts welcome!
