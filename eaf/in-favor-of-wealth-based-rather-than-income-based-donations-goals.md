In a [blog
post](https://vipulnaik.com/blog/my-somewhat-unusual-q4-2021-donation/)
on a recent (non-EA-aligned) donation, I outlined some of my general
thinking about donating. I thought some parts of this general thinking
are worth sharing more broadly.

My central thesis: I've found it more helpful to tie donation targets
to wealth than to income levels, and also to maintain flexibility
around a wide range of possibilities. In particular, I've updated
against setting donation targets as a percentage of income (tithing /
GWWC pledges), though I was never an enthusiastic proponent of it.

The post is structured as follows:

* [The prevailing income-based donation target approach](#the-prevailing-income-based-donation-target-approach)
* [An alternative wealth-based donation target approoach](#an-alternative-wealth-based-donation-target-approach)
* [Comparison of the two approaches](#comparison-of-the-two-approaches)

This post is a sequel of sorts to my post [Donor strategies for
separating "how much" from "where" to
donate](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4R5f4ntM6t3GLoLTw/donor-strategies-for-separating-how-much-from-where-to). That
post was focused on deciding the "how much" to donate versus the
"where" to donate, and in particular on the benefits of predetermined
rules of how much to donate. This post adds a further dimension to the
"how much" question by distinguishing the prevailing income-based
approach from the wealth-based approach. This
income-based/wealth-based approach is almost (but not fully)
orthogonal to the "how much" versus "where" distinction that was the
focus of the previous post.

## The prevailing income-based donation approach

### Key characteristics

The prevailing income-based donation approach has a few key characteristics:

* Donation targets at some cadence (usually yearly) are set as a function of income.
* This function is generally similar to the kinds of functions used in
  taxation: it's a monotonically increasing function that, over a wide
  range, is specified as a percentage of income.
* Somoe donors take the approach of always making actual grants at the
  expected cadence; even those who aren't available to find donees to
  absorb the funds tend to "lock in" the remaining donation amounts by
  donating them into a donor-advised fund or using some other
  commitment mechanism.

### Institutional examples: income-based pledges

Some income-based pledges popularized in the effective altruist
community and its penumbra include:

* [Giving What We Can (GWWC)
  pledge](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/): While the original
  default was 10%, the pledge is now more flexible, with pledgers
  having the option to specify any amount or proportion. The GWWC
  pledge also says "lifetime income" and as far as I know does not
  commit pledgers to making donations annually, but my understanding
  is that annual cadence is the most common interpretation.

* [1 for the world pledge](https://www.1fortheworld.org/pledge-101)
  that is set to 1% of income.

* [The Life You Can Save
  Pledge](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/take-the-pledge/) that is
  also based on income; the suggested percentage of income is
  determined based on the level of income; effectively it is like a
  progressive tax.

### Individual examples

A number of examples, including Jeff Kaufman and Julia Wise, Ben Kuhn,
and others, are listed
[here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4R5f4ntM6t3GLoLTw/donor-strategies-for-separating-how-much-from-where-to#Predetermined_rule_strategy__Use_predetermined_rule_for__how_much__and_decide_the__where__within_that_budget).

## The wealth-based approach

### Characteristics

A wealth-based approach to donations sets donation targets based on
one's wealth. Current wealth is, obviously, tied to income but also to
how long one has been earning income and to saving rate. Long-term
wealth is closely tied to permanent income. A wealth-based approach
commits one to donating a percentage of one's total wealth (or total
wealth above some threshold).

### Institutional examples: wealth-based pledges

* [The Giving Pledge](https://givingpledge.org/), designed for the
  ultra-wealthy, is a pledge to donate the majority (i.e., more than
  50%) of one's wealth to charity.

* [Founders Pledge](https://founderspledge.com/), designed for startup
  founders, is a pledge to donate a percentage of the proceeds from
  the exit of the startup to charity. [The minimum percentage was 2%
  but most commitments were over
  7%](https://www.fastcompany.com/90240242/why-nonprofits-should-be-courting-entrepreneurs-as-donors)
  as of 2015.

### Individual examples

Many individual examples can be found among signatories to the Giving
Pledge and Founders Pledge.

### My own way of thinking about wealth-based donations

Here's a simple table that represents some very broad wealth buckets
and how I'm thinking about donating if and when my wealth gets into
those buckets. I expect some of the structure to also apply to other
people, though the thresholds may differ somewhat (though I expect
interpersonal variance to be less than one order of magnitude).

Wealth range | Qualitative description | How I think about donating if I were at this level of wealth now
-- | -- | --
Under $100,000 | Focus is on maintaining and growing wealth | No proactive donation efforts given current state of world; might be open to truly unusual donation opportunities
$100,000 to $1,000,000 | Growing wealth is still desirable but less of a focus since I don't expect to run out of money unless trying something very risky | Open to donation opportunities; how much I doate is highly sensitive to assessment of details; not proactively looking to spend down my wealth
$1,000,000 to $10,000,000 | Whether growing wealth is desirable depends on long-term life choices (do I want to quit my job, take big risks, have children) | Proactively looking for donation targets
$10,000,000+ | It is almost certain that I will be looking to give away the bulk of my wealth in excess of $10 million | Proactively looking for donation targets and may even fund investigations around identification of such targets if the existing guidance doesn't feel good enough

## Comparison of the two approaches

### Although income-based targets are more common, wealth-based giving probably dominates EA giving

The biggest funders in the EA space, including Dustin Moskovitz via
Good Ventures and Open Philanthropy, Jaan Tallinn via the Survival and
Flourishing Fund, and several others, are donating their *wealth*, not
their income. In Open Philanthropy's case, the spending rate is
determined more by Open Philanthropy's identification of opportunities
than by Moskovitz's annual income. Jaan Tallinn's giving targets by
year are in terms of his wealth, albeit his wealth in cryptocurrency,
so the amount is affected by cryptocurrency prices.

The latest big giving entrant is the [FTX
Foundation](https://ftx.com/en/foundation) that is bankrolled by the
wealth of Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) and his colleagues from running FTX,
a cryptocurrency exchange. SBF did start off as a traditional
earning-to-give person, working in finance on Wall Street and donating
a percentage of his income to charity. However, his new wealth was
almost all acquired since 2017 when he left his job and started
Alameda Research and FTX, and he's committed to donating pretty much
all of the exorbitant multi-billion dollar wealth he has amassed (as
are some of his co-founders).
