In a [blog
post](https://vipulnaik.com/blog/my-somewhat-unusual-q4-2021-donation/)
on a recent (non-EA-aligned) donation, I outlined some of my general
thinking about donating. I thought some parts of this general thinking
are worth sharing more broadly.

My central thesis: I've found it more helpful to tie donation targets
to wealth than to income levels, and also to maintain flexibility
around a wide range of possibilities. In particular, I've updated
against setting donation targets as a percentage of income (tithing /
GWWC pledges), though I was never an enthusiastic proponent of it.

The post is structured as follows:

* [The prevailing income-based donation target approach](#the-prevailing-income-based-donation-target-approach)
* [An alternative wealth-based donation target approoach](#an-alternative-wealth-based-donation-target-approach)
* [Comparison of the two approaches](#comparison-of-the-two-approaches)

This post is a sequel of sorts to my post [Donor strategies for
separating "how much" from "where" to
donate](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4R5f4ntM6t3GLoLTw/donor-strategies-for-separating-how-much-from-where-to). That
post was focused on deciding the "how much" to donate versus the
"where" to donate, and in particular on the pros and cons of
predetermined rules of how much to donate. This post adds a further
dimension to the "how much" question by distinguishing the prevailing
income-based approach from the wealth-based approach. This
income-based/wealth-based approach is almost (but not fully)
orthogonal to the "how much" versus "where" distinction that was the
focus of the previous post.

Scope: While this post should be of interest to people of all stripes
with some philanthropic interests, a lot of the community dynamics
discussions are specific to the effective altruist (EA) community and
causes that enjoy support within the community. Readers who don't
align with the EA community may choose to ignore those parts.

## The prevailing income-based donation approach

### Key characteristics

The prevailing income-based donation approach has a few key characteristics:

* Donation targets at some cadence (usually yearly) are set as a function of income.
* This function is generally similar to the kinds of functions used in
  taxation: it's a monotonically increasing function that, over a wide
  range, is specified as a percentage of income.
* Somoe donors take the approach of always making actual grants at the
  expected cadence; even those who aren't available to find donees to
  absorb the funds tend to "lock in" the remaining donation amounts by
  donating them into a donor-advised fund or using some other
  commitment mechanism.

### Institutional examples: income-based pledges

Some income-based pledges popularized in the effective altruist
community and its penumbra include:

* [Giving What We Can (GWWC)
  pledge](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/): While the original
  default was 10%, the pledge is now more flexible, with pledgers
  having the option to specify any amount or proportion. The GWWC
  pledge also says "lifetime income" and as far as I know does not
  commit pledgers to making donations annually, but my understanding
  is that annual cadence is the most common interpretation.

* [1 for the world pledge](https://www.1fortheworld.org/pledge-101)
  that is set to 1% of income.

* [The Life You Can Save
  Pledge](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/take-the-pledge/) that is
  also based on income; the suggested percentage of income is
  determined based on the level of income; effectively it is like a
  progressive tax.

### Individual examples

A number of examples, including Jeff Kaufman and Julia Wise, Ben Kuhn,
and others, are listed

## The wealth-based approach

### Characteristics

A wealth-based approach to donations sets donation targets based on
one's wealth. Current wealth is, obviously, tied to income but also to
how long one has been earning income and to saving rate. Long-term
wealth is closely tied to permanent income. A wealth-based approach
commits one to donating a percentage of one's total wealth (or total
wealth above some threshold).

### Institutional examples: wealth-based pledges

* [The Giving Pledge](https://givingpledge.org/), designed for the
  ultra-wealthy, is a pledge to donate the majority (i.e., more than
  50%) of one's wealth to charity.

* [Founders Pledge](https://founderspledge.com/), designed for startup
  founders, is a pledge to donate a percentage of the proceeds from
  the exit of the startup to charity. [The minimum percentage was 2%
  but most commitments were over
  7%](https://www.fastcompany.com/90240242/why-nonprofits-should-be-courting-entrepreneurs-as-donors)
  as of 2015.

### Individual examples

Many individual examples can be found among signatories to the Giving
Pledge and Founders Pledge.

### My own way of thinking about wealth-based donations

Here's a simple table that represents some very broad wealth buckets
and how I'm thinking about donating if and when my wealth gets into
those buckets. I expect some of the structure to also apply to other
people, though the thresholds may differ somewhat (though I expect
interpersonal variance to be less than one order of magnitude).

Wealth range | Qualitative description | How I think about donating if I were at this level of wealth now
-- | -- | --
Under $100,000 | Focus is on maintaining and growing wealth | No proactive donation efforts given current state of world; might be open to truly unusual donation opportunities
$100,000 to $1,000,000 | Growing wealth is still desirable but less of a focus since I don't expect to run out of money unless trying something very risky | Open to donation opportunities; how much I donate is highly sensitive to assessment of details; not proactively looking to spend down my wealth
$1,000,000 to $10,000,000 | Whether growing wealth is desirable depends on long-term life choices (do I want to quit my job, take big risks, have children) | Proactively looking for donation targets
$10,000,000+ | It is almost certain that I will be looking to give away the bulk of my wealth in excess of $10 million | Proactively looking for donation targets and may even fund investigations around identification of such targets if the existing guidance doesn't feel good enough

## Comparison of the two approaches

### Although income-based targets are more common, wealth-based giving probably dominates EA giving

The biggest funders in the EA space, including Dustin Moskovitz via
Good Ventures and Open Philanthropy, Jaan Tallinn via the Survival and
Flourishing Fund, and several others, are donating their *wealth*, not
their income. In Open Philanthropy's case, the spending rate is
determined more by Open Philanthropy's identification of opportunities
than by Moskovitz's annual income. Jaan Tallinn's giving targets by
year are in terms of his wealth, albeit his wealth in cryptocurrency,
so the amount is affected by cryptocurrency prices.

The latest big giving entrant is the [FTX
Foundation](https://ftx.com/en/foundation) that is bankrolled by the
wealth of Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) and his colleagues from running FTX,
a cryptocurrency exchange. SBF did start off as a traditional
earning-to-give person, working in finance on Wall Street and donating
a percentage of his income to charity. However, his new wealth was
almost all acquired since 2017 when he left his job and started
Alameda Research and FTX, and he's committed to donating pretty much
all of the exorbitant multi-billion dollar wealth he has amassed (as
are some of his co-founders).

### At an individual level, income-based donations are better distributed over time; community effects unclear

At an *individual* level, those donating at a regular cadence based on
income have a more even distribution of donations over time. Whereas
those using a wealth-based approach will tend to start donating later
in life once they acquire enough wealth.

The individual level, however, is not super-important; the community
level matters more. Nonprofits and organizations in the space can't operate on
expected donations several years in the future, so a steady stream of
funding is important at the community level.

The key question is: how does the individual level translate to the
community level? And specifically, how does this work for the EA
community?

The EA community dominated by younger cohorts would tend to have fewer
donations in the early years until the people in the cohorts get
older. So cash flow could be weak in such communities early on, and
pick up over time. There is also a risk of people experiencing value
drift and leaving the community by the time they get rich.

To some extent, the EA community is dominated by younger cohorts, and
maybe was particularly so dominated back in the early 2010s. For these
reasons, the early 2010s might have been a good time for a norm of
income-based donationo -- particularly from the perspective of
directing money to the community and its favored causes as well as to
growing its own infraustructure.

Now, however, the EA community occupies a wider age range, and has
several grantmaking institutions supporting it, funded by a lot of
wealth. If an individual chooses a wealth-based rather than an
income-based strategy, the time delay effects of that individual's
donations (if the individual happens to be younger) likely have little
effect, and may cancel the time-acceleration effects for older
converts with more accumulated wealth.

### Wealth-based donations is more lottery-like: some donors may end up not donating at all

With a wealth-based donation system, some donors may never rise to the
target levels of wealth needed to start giving money away, whereas
others may end up giving a lot *more* of it away than if they simply
used a percentage of income. The profile of donors will have a much
more "winner-takes-all" feel to it than with an income-based approach.

For those to whom the act of personally making a donation itself
carries a positive valence, there may be a sense of risk-aversion with
respect to the risk of not being a "winner" in terms of getting to
make a donation. Such donors may prefer an income-based approach that
makes it more likely that they will experience the joy and
satisfaction of making donations. With that said, a general theme of
EA is to de-emphasize the donor's own personal feelings as a factor in
the donation decision, so I will set this aside.

TODO: Add discussion on relationship with giving now vs giving later.

### Wealth-based donations suffer from the same decision quality diversity issues as donor lotteries (though with different selection effects)

[Donor lotteries](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/donor-lottery)
have been touted as a way for small donors to get around the problem
that for small donation amounts. the investigation costs are large
compared to the amount being donated. By pooling donations and then
having a winner decide how to spend the money, we benefit from a
larger pool of money allocated relative to the investigation overhead.

Wealth-based donations are a bit like that, both in terms of the "who"
and the "how often" of donation. The "who" because not everybody will
hit the wealth-based targets. The "how often" because they likely
won't hit the targets for at least part of their life, and so the
number of times they have to make donation decisions per unit money is
smaller.

While the reduced investigation overhead is a benefit, the reduced
diversity in decisionmaking, both across people and across time, could
be a cost. With income-based donations, everybody is thinking eevery
year about where to donate. Thus, a diversity of inputs shapes how
funds are directed. With wealth-based donations, fewer people are
making fewer decisions.

In addition, there are selection effects (for better or worse): people
who accumulate wealth are not a random subset of the population, and
the ways they are unusual may correlate positively or negatively with
donation decision quality. Moreover, the additional age needed to
accumulate wealth further creates a bias toward older people.

To some extent, these effects can be reversed if those who have
accummulated the wealth and are donating it do the opposite of a
lottery: delegating the decision of "where" to donate to others, such
as:

* Established organizations like GiveWell
* Hired people at one's own foundation
* Private or public input solicited from others
