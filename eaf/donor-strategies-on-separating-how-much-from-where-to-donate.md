Of late, I have been quite interested in undesrtanding the motivations
and strategies of different donors. My goal is to better understand
the entire dynamics of the ecosystem (of donors and donees affecting
each other). Ultimately, I hope this will help with better figuring
out where this is the most scope for marginal impact.

In this post, I describe different donor strategies on the extent to
which they separate the questions of "how much" to donate from "where"
to donate. In other words, does the donor first decide that they'll
donate a specific amount, and then decide how tot allocate that, or
does the donor first determine whom to donate to, then figure out the
amount to donate?

I describe:

* Three broad strategies that donors use (setting aside now versus
  later considerations): predetermined rule for amount, target
  selection first, and joint optimization

* The role that saving plays in adding nuance to the strategies

* Philosophical assumptions and beliefs that might justify different
  strategies. In particular, I am interersted in exploring assumptions
  and justifications for the predetermined rule strategy.

* Questions for readers

## Three broad strategies that donors use

### Predetermined rule strategy: Use predetermined rule for "how much" and decide the "where" within that budget

A number of donors use prespecified rules for figuring out how much to donate. For instance:

* Jeff Kaufman and Julia Wise: [goal is 50% of pre-tax income](https://www.jefftk.com/p/what-should-income-mean-in-pledging); their donations are [consistent with this goal](https://www.jefftk.com/donations)
* Ben Kuhn: [goal is 50% of pre-tax income](https://www.benkuhn.net/giving-2018); donations for [2017](https://www.benkuhn.net/giving-2017) and [2018](https://www.benkuhn.net/giving-2018) have been consistent with this goal
* Haseeb Qureshi: [goal is 33% of pre-tax income](https://haseebq.com/2018-donations/); donation amounts since 2015 are [consistent with this goal](https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donor.php?donor=Haseeb+Qureshi)
* Aaron Gertler: [goal is 10% of pre-tax income](https://aarongertler.net/donations/)

The charities to which they donate may vary quite a bit between
years. For instance, Haseeb Qureshi switched from donating to a mix of
global health and effective altruism charities, to donating to a mix
of AI safety and effective altruism charities

Beyond individual donors, this strategy also seems encouraged by
various donor pledges. For instance:

* The [One for the World pledge](https://www.1fortheworld.org) sets a target of at least 1% of income to donate
* The [Giving What We Can pledge](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/) sets a target of 10% of income to donate
* [The Life You Can Save pledge](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/take-the-pledge) allows the pledge-taker to determine a percentage, but still pegs the percentage to income
* The [Giving Pledge](https://givingpledge.org) sets a target of 50% of lifetime wealth to donate

### Target selection first strategy: Identify the "where" first, then decide "how much"

I don't know of donors who explicitly declare that they are following
this strategy, but it's probably an implicit one for many donors. This
is a more opportunistic approach to donation: the donor finds a
charity that seems promising to donate to, then figures out how much
the donor can afford to donate to that charity and how much the
charity needs. The donor decides the amount based on that.

Donors who follow this strategy will differ from donors who follow
predetermined rules in a few ways:

* Their giving is expected to fluctuate more year-over-year
* The total amount that they give will react more to new information

### Joint optimization strategy: Decide the "how much" and "where" together

I don't know of donors who explicitly declare that they are following
this strategy, but it's probably an implicit one for many donors.

For instance, this could be a donor who, periodically, looks at their
finances to identify the general range of money that person is willing
to donate. This could, however, be a pretty wide range (potentially
with zero as the lower end). The donor then looks at donation
opportunities. Based on how compelling the donation opportunities are,
and the room for funding of those opportunities, the donor decides
which ones to donate and how much.

In other words, the amount the donor donates can vary based on the
strength of the opportunities (the stronger the opportunities, the
more the donor will donate). The opportunities also compete with one
another; particularly good opportunities may displace others.

## The role that saving plays in adding nuance to the strategies

### Charity, consumption, and saving

If it were not possible to save from one year to the next, the
problem of allocation would simplistically boil down to deciding how
much of one's money to allocate to charity versus how much to allocate
to consumption. Donors following the predetermined rule strategy would
be determining this allocation beforehand, and only after that
allocating *within* the charity and consumption buckets.

However, the ability to save now makes it possible to defer both
charity and consumption to a future year.

With saving introduced into the picture, we could adopt either of two
positions:

* Allocate the saving into "saving for charity" and "saving for
  consumption" at the time of saving (i.e., within the year itself).

* Allocate the saving to a general, fungible pool of saved money, that
  could be used later for either charity or consumption.

### Allowing saving in the predetermined rule strategy

Some people who pledge a percentage of their income (i.e., use a
predetermined rule strategy) may prefer not to donate right now,
because they didn't find good donation targets, or want to investigate
or wait longer. To meet their goal of donating, they may donate into a
donor-advised fund or other vehicle that can hold the funds till a
future donation. Ben Kuhn did this in
[2017](https://www.benkuhn.net/giving-2017) and
[2018](https://www.benkuhn.net/giving-2018).

Donor-advised funds present tax benefits if they are restricted to
only donate for charitable purposes. Some donors who want the
flexibility to donate to things not recognized as charitable in the
tax code may therefore use another vehicle (or perhaps just store the
money in personal savings), thereby not being able to take immediate
tax benefits, while still clearly demarcating the money as "only to be
used" for charity.

### The role of saving for other strategies

For people not using a predetermined rule to decide how much to
donate, they can:

* allocate some of their savings explicitly to a donor-advised fund,
  to avail of tax benefits,

* keep the rest of their savings personal, so that the money could
  opportunistically be used in a later year to finance donations, but
  doesn't have to be used this way

Many of the wealthy people who ultimately signed the Giving Pledge
followed the second strategy, and ultimately decided, after
accumulating a fair amount of wealth, that they could afford to donate
a lot of it.

## Philosophical assumptions and beliefs that might justify different strategies

The strategy that a donor follows is a deeply personal decision based
on a number of personal financial factors, values, and
preferences. So, we cannot draw definite conclusions about the donor's
broader philosophy from whether the donor follows a predetermined rule
strategy. Nonetheless, some philosophical assumptions make some
strategies more justifiable than others.

### For people who trust themselves and want to retain maximum flexibility and don't care about simplifying their lives, a joint optimization strategy seems best

Joint optimization, where the donor decides "how much" and "where"
together, seems to be the strategy that allows the maximum use of
information in making decisions. A donor can take into account
developments both on the charity side (e.g., whether the charities
they are interested in donating to continue to be worthwhile, and
whether they still have room for more funding) and on the consumption
side (e.g., whether the donor had unexpected personal expenses, or
loss of income).

### A predetermined rule strategy may make sense for couples because it avoids haggling and may promote harmony

Disputes over allocation of money can affect a couple's
relationship. If the two members of a couple have different feelings
over how much to donate, it may be most effective to sit down and
figure out a rule beforehand that represents a reasonable compromise
for both sides, rather than try to negotiate the boundary every
year. The couple may also decide how much each member controls of the
charity allocation (just as they may have similar rules on the
consumption side).

### A predetermined rule strategy may be viewed as beneficial in dealing with time-inconsistency issues (people who don't trust their future selves)

The header explains it. Further, saving for charity into a
donor-advised fund (that requires the money to be spent on charity) is
a similar precommitment to hedge against a future, less-charitable
self.

### A prerdetermined rule strategy might be good for norm-setting and community-level predictability

When donors precommit to donating a specific percentage of their
income, this sets a norm for other donors. We can think of the
pledges, such as the One for the World Pledge, GWWC Pledge, and TYLCS
Pledge, as strengthening these norms by giving them more explicit
labels. This norm may encourage other donors to donate more than they
otherwise would.

Also, when there's a significant amount of money flowing into
charities' coffers from the predetermined rule, charities, and the
community as a whole, know that some amount of money can be counted
on. This is true even if individual charities don't know for sure if
the money will go to them -- at least they know that there's enough of
a pool of money that's committed to charity that they might hope to
get. If the amount of money that's committed is more than enough to
meet the budgets of the charities that the donors are considering,
each charity can be somewhat confident that they'll get at least some
of it (because the other charities' room for more funding would be
exhausted before the donors had spent out all the money they
committed).

### Predetermined rule strategies make sense for people who believe that their opinion of the "right" amount to donate to charity isn't likely to change with new evidence or developments

Having a predetermined rule doesn't seem to hurt much if the donor
believes things in this general cluster about giving opportunities:

* The donor's opinion of what cause area matters the most won't change
  much, *or* the right amount to donate won't change much even if the
  donor's opinion changes.

* Cost-effectiveness estimates in the area won't change much, *or* the
  right amount to donate is not sensitive to cost-effectiveness
  estimates (see below).

* The entry or exit of other major donors to the cause areas or
  charities of interest is unlikely, *or* such entry or exit won't
  affect the right amount to donate

Also, it makes sense if the donor believes things in this general
cluster about personal finances:

* The structure of the predetermined rule (whether in terms of income
  and wealth) makes sense across different possibilities for the
  person's wealth, for instance, if the person has to leave a job, or
  has some other unexpected accident or other expense (such as a
  wedding, or kid). [From this viewpoint, donating a percentage of
  income may not make sense; donating a percentage of
  income-above-a-threshold may be more sustainable]

Of course, there are degrees of commitment, and "predetermined rule"
doesn't necessarily mean "predetermined rule for life". So, a more
accurate way of framing this is that predetermined rule strategies
make sense if the donor doesn't expect changes to the "right" amount
to donate within the timeframe that the donor has committed to. In
other words, the right amount to donate shouldn't be too
fluid. (However, it's different for people who take lifetime pledges,
which might be why there is some criticism of lifelong pledging from
[Buck Shlegeris](http://shlegeris.com/2017/07/21/ea) and [Andrew
Critch](https://acritch.com/pledging/)).

#### My past puzzlement at insensitivity to cost-effectiveness estimates

A few years ago, I had trouble understanding this belief that the
"right" amount to donate doesn't change much with cost-effectiveness
estimates. I even wrote a [long comment on the GiveWell blog about
this](https://blog.givewell.org/2013/06/11/the-moral-case-for-giving-doesnt-rely-on-questionable-quantitative-estimates/#comment-572951). Later,
I asked the question on the [Effective Altruism Facebook
group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/656749537714740/),
where there were a number of interesting replies.

## Questions for readers

My goal with posting this to the Effective Altruism Forum is partly to
provide a concrete public record of my thoughts. However, I'm also
interested in hearing thoughts from people on the Forum, many of whom
are donors of the sort I try to understand in the post.

Some questions I'm particularly interested in hearing thoughts on:

* What's your strategy as a donor? Does it fit within the three broad
  types of strategies I describe in the post?

* Are there other aspects of these strategies that you consider
  important, that I missed? For instance, are there some other pros
  and cons of predetermined rule strategies?

* My impression is that the effective altruism (EA) community uses
  predetermined rules more than other donors, who come closer to
  "target selection first" or "joint optimization" in their strategy
  (i.e., they are more likely to be moved by specific events or
  developments in their decision of how much to donate). Am I right,
  and if so, is this good?
