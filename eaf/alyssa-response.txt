I would say it depends a lot on the type of content being criticized. If you are criticizing a person or organization about their holistic behavior (e.g., the organization's pattern of activities, spending, funding, advertising, etc.) then I think it is reasonable to run the relevant facts by the organization or a representative thereof. If it's a domain where you expect them to have special knowledge beyond what's available in the public sphere (or known to you), I think it is a win-win to reach out early.

I don't think this case fit those criteria. The tweet, and the criticism, were about general facts regarding the world, where neither Will nor Alyssa have privileged insider information. I think applying a norm of running criticisms of this sort by the original poster is unnecessary and counterproductive. There may have been better ways to frame the criticism (specifically, by eliminating anything that makes it look like a personal attack) but running it by the poster isn't one of them, I think.
