First comment:

I would say it depends a lot on the type of content being criticized. If you are criticizing a person or organization about their holistic behavior (e.g., the organization's pattern of activities, spending, funding, advertising, etc.) then I think it is reasonable to run the relevant facts by the organization or a representative thereof. If it's a domain where you expect them to have special knowledge beyond what's available in the public sphere (or known to you), I think it is a win-win to reach out early.

I don't think this case fit those criteria. The tweet, and the criticism, were about general facts regarding the world, where neither Will nor Alyssa have privileged insider information. I think applying a norm of running criticisms of this sort by the original poster is unnecessary and counterproductive. There may have been better ways to frame the criticism (specifically, by eliminating anything that makes it look like a personal attack) but running it by the poster isn't one of them, I think.

Second comment:

I'd also add that there is a pretty low bar being applied here to "publication" -- a Facebook post in response to a tweet! High standards may be desirable when e.g. publishing something in the New Yorker or even on the Effective Altruism Forum, but do they make sense for every comment on social media, commit on GitHub, or edit on Google Docs or HackPad? Sharing your thoughts with a wider audience more quickly is important to get feedback (positive or negative). I think that as long as you as a poster feel you aren't missing obvious public information (or easily revealed private information that the subject of your critique would readily give you) your obligations end there.

For instance, I think the effort I put in for https://www.facebook.com/vipulnaik.r/posts/10210743203232119 is reasonable (this DID include some information collected through private correspondence with GiveWell, in addition to public information); running the entire document or Facebook post by GiveWell staff would have added unnecessary cycles.
