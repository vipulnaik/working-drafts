On March 31, 2019, I made a donation of 3200 GBP to the [EA
Hotel](https://eahotel.org)
[fundraiser](https://eahotel.org/fundraiser/) via
[GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/ea-hotel). The donation cost me
$4,306.14 USD. My decision was based mainly on the information in the
EA Hotel page and the [documents linked from the donations list
website page on EA
Hotel](https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donee.php?donee=EA+Hotel#doneeDocumentList),
which include the recent Effective Altruism Forum posts.

In this post, I describe the reasons that influenced my decision to
donate. I did think through the skeleton of this post before donating,
but didn't draft the post *before* donating, so some of the
elaboration includes aspects I had not explicitly considered before
donating.

I limited the time I spend writing the post, and will most likely not
be able to respond to comments. But please feel free to comment with
your thoughts in response to my post or other comments!

The sections of the post:

* [I like the idea of the EA Hotel](#i-like-the-idea-of-the-ea-hotel)
* [I like the skin-in-the-game of the key players](#i-like-the-skin-in-the-game-of-the-key-players)
* [I like the execution so far](#i-like-the-execution-so-far)
* [I see institutional risk reasons for lack of institutional funding](#i-see-institutional-risk-reasons-for-lack-of-institutional-funding): These reasons don't apply to individual donors, so I am not too concerned about the lack of institutional funding as a reason to dissuade me from donating
* [I have not been dissuaded by the reasons against donating that I have seen so far](#i-have-not-been-dissuaded-by-the-reasons-against-donating-that-i-have-seen-so-far)
