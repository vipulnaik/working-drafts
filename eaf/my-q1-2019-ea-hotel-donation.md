On March 31, 2019, I made a donation of 3200 GBP to the [EA
Hotel](https://eahotel.org)
[fundraiser](https://eahotel.org/fundraiser/) via
[GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/ea-hotel). The donation cost me
$4,306.14 USD. My decision was based mainly on the information in the
EA Hotel page and the [documents linked from the donations list
website page on EA
Hotel](https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donee.php?donee=EA+Hotel#doneeDocumentList),
which include the recent Effective Altruism Forum posts.

In this post, I describe the reasons that influenced my decision to
donate. I did think through the skeleton of this post before donating,
but didn't draft the post *before* donating, so some of the
elaboration includes aspects I had not explicitly considered before
donating.

I limited the time I spend writing the post, and will most likely not
be able to respond to comments. But please feel free to comment with
your thoughts in response to my post or other comments!

## I like the idea of the EA Hotel

My interpretation of the fundamental problem the EA Hotel is trying to
solve: provide low-cost and optimized transient living arrangements to
people engaged in self-study or early stages of projects. The hotel's
low-cost living arrangements are further subsidized so that long-term
residents don't have to pay anything at all, and in fact, get a
stipend to cover some living expenses. This means that residents can
pursue projects with single-minded focus without burning through
savings or having to do additional jobs just to keep themselves
financially afloat.

The backdrop of the problem, as I understand:

* EA communities have congregated in some of the most expensive places
  in the world, such as the San Francisco Bay Area, Boston/Cambridge,
  New York City, and London. Even outside of these, most places with
  significant numbers of EAs tend to be cities, and these tend to have
  higher costs of living.

* Most EA projects have trouble raising enough money to cover costs of
  living in these places, even after they get funding. Moreover, most
  EA organizations, which are also based in these areas, do not pay
  enough of a premium for people to build savings that would allow
  them to comfortably spend months working on such projects in these
  expensive locations.

* Tendencies within EA to donate large fractions of one's personal
  wealth may have further exacerbated people's lack of adequate
  savings to pursue EA projects.

These problems, specially the first one, have been widely
acknowledged. Attempts to figure out a new, lower-cost city for EAs
and build group housing in that city started since as far back as
2014, when the [Coordination of Rationality/EA/SSC Housing Project
group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/664817953593844/) was
[created](https://www.facebook.com/groups/664817953593844/permalink/664817956927177/). Browsing
through the archives of that Facebook group is interesting because it
shows the amount of effort that has gone in over the years in
identifying lower-cost living places for EAs. This is the group where
Greg Colbourn [first
announced](https://www.facebook.com/groups/664817953593844/permalink/1481373815271583/)
his intention to buy a hotel in Blackpool.

## I like the skin-in-the-game of the key players

One of the main problems with executing a project like the EA Hotel is
that it is capital-intensive: a lot of money needs to be put in to
implement an idea like this in a manner that is low-cost in the long
run. For instance, a lot more money is needed to buy a hotel
wholesale, like Greg did, even at the low rates he was able to get.

I find it impressive that Greg put his own money into purchasing the
building and financing the first year of the hotel's operations, at a
time when getting outside support would be hard.

Also, browsing through the [Coordination of Rationality/EA/SSC Housing
Project group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/664817953593844/)
archives, it looks like both Greg and Toon Alfrink, the hotel's
manager, have participated in the group for quite a while. While that
doesn't in and of itself mean much, it does underscore their long-term
commitment to the vision.

Skin-in-the-game of key players is very important for me when making a
sizable donation to an organization that has not yet achieved the
level of financial stability that would make its survival automatic.

## I like the execution so far

This breaks down into a lot of pieces:

* I like both the high demand and the competence exhibited in meeting
  the demand effectively
* I like that the residents are very positive about the hotel
* I find the resident profiles and their projects reasonably
  impressive
* I like the cost-effectiveness of the hotel and think it solves the
  problem (of providing low-cost living) that it set out to solve

### I like both the high demand and the competence exhibited in meeting the demand effectively

Starting a new project and immediately getting traction is
impressive. It's even more impressive to have been able to cope well
with the demand and keep the hotel residents satisfied. After a little
over half a year of running the hotel, the hotel is already running at
close to full capacity, and hotel residents have been quite positive
about their experience at the hotel; see for instance
[grue_slinky](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ek299LpWZvWuoNeeg/usd100-prize-to-best-argument-against-donating-to-the-ea)
and
[halffull](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sigun924gsxN4oZq2/the-case-for-the-ea-hotel). The
description of the [residents so
far](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/j7xz4rQidfRgFo6KC/ea-hotel-fundraiser-2-current-guests-and-their-projects)
and the [projects and work
completed](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dLGM88JRE96iHd7z4/ea-hotel-fundraiser-4-concrete-outputs-after-10-months)
are both decent, and particularly good for something that's just
gotten off the ground.

I also like that, as far as I can make out, the general cost estimates
and projections have been met. I find that the total cost per resident
is low and meets the goals that we might expect such a project to
meet.

Let's dig more into this. The official estimate for the EA Hotel is a
cost of 5700 GBP per resident per year, including the stipend paid out
to them. That translates to about $7500 USD per person per year.

How low-cost is this compared to other options? It's definitely
cheaper than the average deal in the San Francisco Bay Area or New
York City. My anecdotal evidence suggests it would be very very hard
to get a place in the San Francisco Bay Area where even the rent +
utilities is lower than $7500/year, and once you add food, it will
clearly exceed that range. Landing a good deal like this would itself
take weeks if not months of searching, time that can burn savings or
runway.

I know of two categories of options that would be cheaper than the EA
Hotel:

* Living with others who are taking care of the main living expenses:
  This could mean living with parents or with a spouse, a sibling, or
  friends, who are shouldering the majority of the household living
  expenses. Depending on the living arrangement, the marginal cost of
  the resident may not be too high. For instance, you might be living
  with your parents in a room in their house, but they wouldn't have
  rented it out otherwise, so the effective rent cost is zero. Food,
  utilities, etc. are all shared, and the marginal cost of your food
  and utilities would likely be in the $200 to $400 range. Similar
  arrangements may exist with a spouse or sibling.

* Living in a much lower-cost part of the world: Example places
  include Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, and South Asia.

The disadvantages of these options:

* Some people may not have others willing to take care of main living
  expenses, or may not be comfortable seeking their help: In
  particular, a person who quits a well-paying job to work on an EA
  project may not feel comfortable or welcomed reducing living costs
  by going and living with their parents.

* Living in places with different culture and language may not be
  conducive to focusing on an EA project: Going to Thailand or Romania
  to cut costs may mean too much adjustment time and effort and not
  enough resources left to focus on the project.

* In both cases, one does not have the advantage of being plugged into
  a network of other people also working on and motivated to make
  progress on similar projects.

Based on this analysis, I think the EA Hotel offers a good option that
is not clearly dominated by any other. Morevoer, the general idea of
having such a hotel, if successful, could be replicated in other
locations. That would lead to a wider range of price points to meet
the needs of people with different trade-offs.

## I see institutional risk reasons for lack of institutional funding

According to [a comment on a question asking why the EA Hotel is
having trouble fundraising](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BNQbxX7bFRrgv8Yds/why-is-the-ea-hotel-having-trouble-fundraising#hKjqSkH3cF7Gx42KK):

> EA Grants is taking a long time to review the hotel's

> several of the following: (a.) staffing issues at CEA which have
> only recently been resolved; (b.) desire to perform an audit/review
> of the hotel. Also, to see some operational changes at the hotel

> the hotel as a countermeasure against cultural dilution, or PR
> risk. (c.) seems unlikely.

I can't speak to the accuracy of the claims here, but they are
suggestive.

The EA Hotel is a sufficiently distinctive project, and also an
incubator of many other projects, that institutions funding it may
perceive risk to their reputation from even one of the funded projects
by the EA Hotel going wrong. I don't expect this to prevent the EA
Hotel from getting institutionally funded in the long run. But I do
expect the process to take longer. I think a stronger, longer track
record will be needed before it gets funded by EA Funds, EA Grants, or
other larger sources of funding in the EA community.

This means that individual donors, who have less of these
institutional risk concerns, have a bigger role to play in the
beginning.
