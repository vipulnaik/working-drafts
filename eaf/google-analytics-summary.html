<p>As 2016 comes to a close, I thought it'd be interesting to look at traffic trends on the Effective Altruism Forum since its launch around September 7, 2014. Some key takeaways follow, after which I discuss more of the data.</p>
<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li>Annual cycle and long-term growth trends: (<a href="#negligible-year-over-year-growth">more</a>)
<ul>
<li>December and January see the highest traffic in the year, as expected considering it is Giving Season (though the relative role of demand for content and supply of content is unclear). The summer months see the lowest traffic. This seasonal fluctuation is more significant than year-over-year growth.</li>
<li>Overall, year-over-year growth in total pageviews has been about 10% per year. It is swamped by other sources of fluctuation (so for a given month it could even be negative, and for some months it could be as high as 30%). From late 2014 to late 2015, there was a significant increase in sessions accompanied by a decrease in pages/session that roughly canceled. In 2016, sessions and pages/session have remained roughly constant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Impact of EA events (<a href="#impact-of-ea-events">more</a>): EA Global and other similar events have negligible traffic impact, whether we look at impact during the event, shortly before or after the event, or long-term before versus after changes.</li>
<li>Post traffic lifecycle (norms and exceptions) (<a href="#post-traffic-lifecycle-norms-and-exceptions">more</a>):
<ul>
<li>The majority of posts get almost all their traffic in the first few days after they are published. The traffic may come from social media and other referrals, or people discovering the content from the home page.</li>
<li>A few pieces of content get sustained traffic over a long period of time. This could be steady traffic or traffic resulting from multiple traffic spikes. Some of these pieces are generic EA classics, and others are about tangentially related subjects of wider interest. No articles exclusively about EA organizations or personal donation decisions have made it to this list.</li>
<li>The size of the initial traffic to a post correlates far more closely with other indicators of post traction (such as comments and net upvotes on the post) than the long-term traffic to the post. On the other hand, Facebook likes + comments + shares correlate more with long-term traffic than initial traffic, though I have less confidence about that conclusion (due to more limited data).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="annual-cycle-and-long-term-growth-trends">Annual cycle and long-term growth trends</h3>
<p>Here's a graph of monthly pageviews in Google Analytics. Note that since the site was launched after a few days of September 2014 were already over, the September 2014 number represents a period shorter than a month.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-traffic-all-time.png" alt="Google Analytics pageview data for Effective Altruism Forum, September 2014 to December 2016" width="600" height="222" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see that December and January have higher traffic than the surrounding months for the end of 2014 end-of-year Giving Season. For the 2015 end-of-year Giving Season, February (so February 2016) actually has slightly higher traffic than January, but you can still see the same qualitative picture: a sharp rise in traffic in December, a decline in January, and a return to normalcy soon. For the 2016 end-of-year Giving Season, we only have December data, and we see a pretty huge rise from November to December.</p>
<p>An year-over-year comparison between EAF's first year (September 7, 2014 to September 6, 2015, compared with September 7, 2015 to September 6, 2016) shows a 9.86% increase in pageviews (from 314,789 to 345,832), a 21.53% increase in sessions, and a 26.97% increase in users. Pages/session and average session duration fell.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-sessions-and-pps.png" alt="Google Analytics sessions and pages/session" width="600" height="222" /></p>
<p>Looking at some specific months shows how noise overwhelms this slight long-term increase. For instance, in September 2014 (the month of launch, where a few days were missing since those were pre-launch), there were 26,256 pageviews. The corresponding numbers in September 2015 and September 2016 were 30,467 (+16.0% year-over-year) and 26,347 (-14.5% year-over-year). For October, the numbers in 2014, 2015, and 2016 were respectively 25,237, 26,259 (+4.0% year-over-year), and 32,880 (+25.2% year-over-year).</p>
<p>With that said, there is clearer evidence of year-over-year growth for November and December. As a result, the gap between Giving Season and other months has been increasing from 2014 to 2015 to 2016.</p>
<p>Data is very limited but one tentative theory that fits the evidence so far is that the growth of the EA movement has been strongest among readers whose interest in EAF content is high only during Giving Season. Another is that content creators are focusing their content creation and publishing efforts more during Giving Season and less during other months, and this is increasing the traffic difference between Giving Season and other months.</p>
<p>One interesting trend between late 2014 and late 2015: although the increase in number of pageviews was small, sessions increased quite a bit. Pages/session dropped to compensate. This could be because people began using EAF more on their phones (thus increasing the number of sessions and users recorded by GA). It could be because the number of people accessing EAF increased, but the interest and dedication of the early adopters declined.</p>
<h3 id="impact-of-ea-events">Impact of EA events</h3>
<p>The main story regarding EA events is the non-story: there is no increase in traffic to EAF in or around EA Global or major events. I got a list of events from <a href="/ea/vx/effects_of_major_events_on_ea_activity/">Effects of major events on EA activity</a> by Eric Yu. His post didn't discuss effects on EAF traffic, although the <a href="/ea/u1/is_ea_growing_a_concrete_study_idea_to_find_out/">original post by Peter Hurford</a> that his post answered had asked for that data. So I thought this would be a good set of events to look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>GWWC pledge drive 2014&ndash;2015: a few weeks around 1/1/2015: Traffic was lower in January than December, but it's hard to isolate the effects of the GWWC Pledge Drive from the general Giving Season cycle.<br /><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-end-2014-giving-season.png" alt="Google Analytics pageviews for end 2014 Giving Season" width="600" height="219" /></li>
<li>GWWC pledge drive 2015&ndash;2016: a few weeks around 1/1/2016: Same comment as for the previous pledge drive.<br /><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-end-2015-giving-season.png" alt="Google Analytics for end of 2015 Giving Season" width="600" height="225" /></li>
<li>EA Global 2015: 7/31-8/2, 2015 (SF), 8/14-8/16 (Melbourne), 8/28-8/30 (Oxford): Traffic was lower during the days of the summits than the surrounding days. This could be due to it being a weekend. It could be because the in-person event substituted for website visits and reduced the amount of content being posted. Overall, traffic in August was the same as July, so it doesn't seem like EA Global increased traffic to EAF in the surrounding days. Moreover, most of the pages that were visited during these events were qualitatively similar to the pages that were visited before and after them. The main exception was the <a href="//ea/lr/august_open_thread_ea_global/">August open thread</a>, that got a total of 304 views, most of them in the days right after the event ended. The view count for this was too small to meaningfully affect overall traffic.<br /><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-eag-2015.png" alt="Google Analytics July/August 2015 traffic, around the time of EA Global" width="600" height="227" /><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-eag-2015-open-thread.png" alt="Google Analytics EAG 2015 Open Thread" width="600" height="226" /></li>
<li>Doing Good Better published: 7/28/2015 (around the same time as EA Global): Traffic was higher on this day but the qualitative pattern of posts viewed wasn't different from other days, suggesting that the publication of the book wasn't the driving factor for the traffic increase.</li>
<li>The Most Good You Can Do published: 3/15/2015 (published on Amazon 4/7/2015): Traffic moved up and down around this time and there wasn't a clear effect on overall traffic. The qualitative nature of articles visited also didn't change. Note that this is in contrast with the <a href="http://www.wikipediatrends.com/Effective_altruism.html">Wikipedia page for effective altruism</a>, where the publication of the book approximately marked a permanent increase in the traffic level to the article.<br /><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-tmgycd.png" alt="Google Analytics March/April 2015 traffic, around release of Peter Singer's book" width="600" height="222" /></li>
<li>GiveWell top charities announced (2015&ndash;2016): 11/20/2015 (corrected date from source): Also hard to isolate the effect of this relative to Giving Season changes. Looking at traffic to posts with GiveWell in the title, we see spikes at various points in time related to posts about GiveWell, but these don't correspond to the timing of GiveWell's recommendation release.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="post-traffic-lifecycle-norms-and-exceptions">Post traffic lifecycle: norms and exceptions</h3>
<p>The vast majority of EAF posts get the vast majority of their traffic within a few days of publication, and all the associated engagement activity (post upvotes and comments) also occurs within that time. This time can vary from a day to a little over a week. Typical examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/ea/146/president_trump_as_a_global_catastrophic_risk/">President Trump as a Global Catastrophic Risk</a> (12 net upvotes, 15 comments, 89 Facebook likes + comments + shares)<br /><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-post-trump-gcr.png" alt="Google Analytics traffic: President Trump as a Global Catastrophic Risk" width="600" height="226" /></li>
<li><a href="/ea/jv/introducing_effective_altruism_policy_analytics/">Introducing Effective Altruism Policy Analytics: Request for help and expert consultation</a> (10 net upvotes, 10 comments, 94 Facebook likes + comments + shares)<br /><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-post-introducing-eapa.png" alt="Google Analytics for post &quot;Introducing Effective Altruism Policy Analytics: Request for help and expert consultation&quot;" width="600" height="223" /></li>
<li><a href="/ea/sm/ea_is_elitist_should_it_stay_that_way/">EA is elitist. Should it stay that way?</a> (11 net upvotes, 34 comments, 2 Facebook likes + comments + shares)<br /><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-post-ea-elitist.png" alt="Google Analytics traffic for post &quot;EA is Elitist. Should it stay that way?&quot;" width="600" height="224" /></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the top viewed items of all time display a different pattern. Like the other posts, they have a spike around the time of initial publication (or initial import into EAF), and much of the engagement activity (upvotes, comments) occurs within that time. However, <em>unlike</em> other posts, the top viewed items continue to get a steady trickle of views later in life, or additional later spikes in traffic, long after active engagement with them (in the form of comments and upvotes) has died down.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy feature of the top posts is that many of them were imported into EAF, or cross-posted to EAF, from other places (such as LessWrong, or the old Effective Altruism blog that was hosted on the same domain).</p>
<p>The situation with Facebook likes + comments + shares seems similar to long-term traffic (and therefore different from comments and upvotes on EAF): posts that continue to get a steady trickle of views also continue to get a steady trickle of Facebook likes, comments, and shares. However, I don't have good time series data on Facebook likes, comments, and shares, so this is just a rough estimate based on what i do have.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-top-posts-all-time.png" alt="Top posts of all time according to Google Analytics" width="600" height="377" /></p>
<p>Here are the top five posts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/ea/6x/introduction_to_effective_altruism/">Introduction to Effective Altruism</a> (20 net upvotes, 5 comments, 292 Facebook likes + comments + shares), averaged about 50 pageviews a day from mid-2015 to August 2016, and then dropped to about 10 pageviews a day ((probably due to competition from <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/">Introduction to Effective Altruism on effectivealtruism.org</a>).<br /><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-post-intro-to-ea.png" alt="Google Analytics for post &quot;Introduction to Effective Altruism&quot;" width="600" height="226" /></li>
<li><a href="/ea/6u/the_drowning_child_and_the_expanding_circle/">The Drowning Child and the Expanding Circle</a> (8 net upvotes, 8 comments, 138 Facebook likes + comments + shares) sees traffic in waves, with sudden spikes after some sort of media publicity and then gradual decay over time, till the next spike.<br /><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-post-drowning-child.png" alt="Google Analytics for post: &quot;The Drowning Child and the Expanding Circle&quot;" width="600" height="224" /></li>
<li><a href="/ea/45/what_is_effective_altruism/">What is Effective Altruism?</a> (7 net upvotes, 7 comments, 16 Facebook likes + comments + shares) had a traffic spike in July 2015, after which it saw 20 pageviews a day for a while. The number has decayed gradually and is now about 5 a day. <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=what%20is%20effective%20altruism">Search query competition</a> could explain the decline.<br /><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-post-what-is-ea.png" alt="Google Analytics for post &quot;What is Effective Altruism?&quot;" width="600" height="225" /></li>
<li><a href="/ea/5e/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/">Efficient charity: do unto others...</a> (13 net upvotes, 5 comments, 87 Facebook likes + comments + shares) spiked in late January 2016, and has since fluctuated, averaging between 2 and 15 pageviews a day.<br /><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-post-efficient-charity.png" alt="Google Analytics for post &quot;Efficient charity: do unto others&quot;" width="600" height="225" /></li>
<li><a href="/ea/c8/should_you_donate_to_the_wikimedia_foundation/">Should you donate to the Wikimedia Foundation?</a> (10 net upvotes, 3 comments, 126 Facebook likes + comments + shares) had three spikes: one at the time of initial writing (in late March 2015), and two more during the Giving Seasons of 2015 and 2016, coinciding with the Wikimedia Foundation fundraisers through Wikipedia banners. Disclosure: I wrote this post, and have spent some time understanding its view statistics.<br /><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-post-donate-wikimedia.png" alt="Google Analytics for post &quot;Should you donate to the Wikimedia Foundation?&quot;" width="600" height="224" /></li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the top five, the picture becomes more mixed. The sixth and seventh article, namely <a href="/ea/x4/philosophical_critiques_of_effective_altruism_by/">Philosophical Critiques of Effective Altruism by Prof Jeff McMahan</a> and <a href="/ea/4r/cheerfully/">Cheerfully</a>, had only one spike at time of publication, but do still get a very slow but still steady trickle of traffic. In eighth place is the wide-interest article <a href="/ea/fh/six_ways_to_get_along_with_people_who_are_totally/">Six Ways To Get Along With People Who Are Totally Wrong*</a>. This has had three big spikes and a much much smaller steady stream of views.</p>
<p>The most-commented article I could find was <a href="/ea/12z/concerns_with_intentional_insights/">Concerns with Intentional Insights</a>, with 39 net upvotes and 182 comments, and 60 Facebook likes + comments + shares. This placed ninth in terms of lifetime pageviews. The traffic to this article had a single, really huge spike at the time of launch, and has since been pretty low.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-post-concerns-with-ii.png" alt="Googe Analytics traffic for post: &quot;Concerns with Intentional Insights&quot;" width="600" height="224" /></p>
<h3 id="speculative-thoughts-on-implications">Speculative thoughts on implications</h3>
<p>The slow increase in total traffic to EAF suggests some tempering of the widespread narrative of rapid EA movement growth. It would be interesting to understand why EAF traffic lags other widely cited indicators of movement growth, such as GWWC pledge sign-ups and GiveWell money moved. A number of plausible theories can be proposed. For instance, it could be that EAF appeals only to a segment of EAs (and EA-penumbra people) and this segment is not represented well in new recruits. On the other hand, it could be that EAF has huge churn, so that even though the EA movement is growing, EAF membership at any given time isn't growing that fast because people leave quickly. It's also possible that the problems are on the supply side (not enough quality content on EAF, or more competition for readers' attention.</p>
<p>More interesting (to me) than the overall traffic trend is the question of what the pageviews and other metrics for specific posts can tell us about the impact of those posts. Content creators get feedback on posts based on initial traction in the form of comments and upvotes, which correlate well with initial pageviews. But for the best-performing posts in the long term, a lot of the pageviews happen over time, and the long-term pageview trend is not as correlated with the initial spike in pageviews as we might think.</p>
<p>One possible implication is that content creators on EAF may be overproducing content that gets a lot of initial traction, at the expense of creating evergreen content with long-term value. Of course, this implication is far from proven, as it's not clear that long-term pageviews are a good indicator of long-term value. But even if it's not, analogous reasoning might apply for long-term value.</p>
<p>Take a look at the top five posts. Four of them are generic, evergreen content whose relevance declines very slowly over time. The fifth one (on donating to the Wikimedia Foundation) is more specific, but the topic it touches on, namely donations to Wikipedia, is something that a sizable fraction of the Internet-using population comes across during Giving Season. Contrast this with a post like <a href="/ea/12z/concerns_with_intentional_insights/">Concerns with Intentional Insights</a> that gets a lot of interest when it is published but does not address a recurring, long-term human need, and therefore dies down quickly.</p>
<p>Another implication is around the way we link to older material. A lot of content is high-quality, but fails to get visited after a huge amount of traffic in the first week. Regulars forget about the content, newcomers never hear of it. Better, stronger linking practices to older content, and more high-quality followup posts that help revive older content, could help address this. Discussions and debates advance when people build on top of past material, rather than regenerate or rehash it, so a strong memory of past content, reinforced through extensive linking to it, can help.</p>
