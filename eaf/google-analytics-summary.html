<p>As 2016 comes to a close, I thought it'd be interesting to look at traffic trends on the Effective Altruism Forum since its launch around September 7, 2014. Some key takeaways follow, after which I discuss more of the data.</p>
<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li>Annual cycle and long-term growth trends: (<a href="#negligible-year-over-year-growth">more</a>)
<ul>
<li>December and January see the highest traffic in the year, as expected considering it is Giving Season (though the relative role of demand for content and supply of content is unclear). The summer months see the lowest traffic. This seasonal fluctuation is more significant than year-over-year growth.</li>
<li>Overall, year-over-year growth in total pageviews has been about 10% per year. It is swamped by other sources of fluctuation (so for a given month it could even be negative, and for some months it could be as high as 30%). From late 2014 to late 2015, there was a significant increase in sessions accompanied by a decrease in pages/session that roughly canceled. In 2016, sessions and pages/session have remained roughly constant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Impact of EA events (<a href="#impact-of-ea-events">more</a>): EA Global and other similar events have negligible traffic impact, whether we look at impact during the event, shortly before or after the event, or long-term before versus after changes.</li>
<li>Post traffic lifecycle (norms and exceptions) (<a href="#post-traffic-lifecycle-norms-and-exceptions">more</a>):
<ul>
<li>The majority of posts get almost all their traffic in the first few days after they are published. The traffic may come from social media and other referrals, or people discovering the content from the home page.</li>
<li>A few pieces of content get sustained traffic over a long period of time. This could be steady traffic or traffic resulting from multiple traffic spikes. Some of these pieces are generic EA classics, and others are about tangentially related subjects of wider interest. No articles exclusively about EA organizations or personal donation decisions have made it to this list.</li>
<li>The size of the initial traffic to a post correlates far more closely with other indicators of post traction (such as comments and net upvotes on the post) than the long-term traffic to the post.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="annual-cycle-and-long-term-growth-trends">Annual cycle and long-term growth trends</h3>
<p>Here's a graph of monthly pageviews in Google Analytics. Note that since the site was launched after a few days of September 2014 were already over, the September 2014 number represents a period shorter than a month.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-traffic-all-time.png" alt="Google Analytics pageview data for Effective Altruism Forum, September 2014 to December 2016" width="600" height="222" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see that December and January have higher traffic than the surrounding months in 2014. In 2015, February actually has slightly higher traffic than January, but you can still see the same qualitative picture: a sharp rise in traffic in December, a decline in January, and a return to normalcy soon. For the 2016 end-of-year Giving Season, we only have December data, and we see a pretty huge rise from November to December.</p>
<p>An year-over-year comparison between EAF's first year (September 7, 2014 to September 6, 2015, compared with September 7, 2015 to September 6, 2016) shows a 9.86% increase in pageviews (from 314,789 to 345,832), a 21.53% increase in sessions, and a 26.97% increase in users. Pages/session and average session duration fell.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-sessions-and-pps.png" alt="Google Analytics sessions and pages/session" width="600" height="222" /></p>
<p>Looking at some specific months shows how noise overwhelms this slight long-term increase. For instance, in September 2014 (the month of launch, where a few days were missing since those were pre-launch), there were 26,256 pageviews. The corresponding numbers in September 2015 and September 2016 were 30,467 (+16.0% year-over-year) and 26,347 (-14.5% year-over-year). For October, the numbers in 2014, 2015, and 2016 were respectively 25,237, 26,259 (+4.0% year-over-year), and 32,880 (+25.2% year-over-year).</p>
<p>With that said, there is clearer evidence of year-over-year growth for November and December. As a result, the gap between Giving Season and other months has been increasing from 2014 to 2015 to 2016.</p>
<p>Data is very limited but one tentative theory that fits the evidence so far is that the growth of the EA movement has been strongest people whose interest in EAF content is high only during Giving Season. Another is that content creators are focusing their content creation and publishing efforts more during Giving Season and less during other months, and this is increasing the traffic difference between Giving Season and other months.</p>
<p>One interesting trend between late 2014 and late 2015: although the increase in number of pageviews was small, sessions increased quite a bit. Pages/session dropped to compensate. This could be because people began using EAF more on their phones (thus increasing the number of sessions and users recorded by GA). It could be because the number of people accessing EAF increased, but the interest and dedication of the early adopters declined.</p>
<h3 id="impact-of-ea-events">Impact of EA events</h3>
<p>The main story regarding EA events is the non-story: there is no increase in traffic to EAF in or around EA Global or major events. I got a list of events from <a href="/ea/vx/effects_of_major_events_on_ea_activity/">Effects of major events on EA activity</a> by Eric Yu. His post didn't discuss effects on EAF traffic, although the <a href="/ea/u1/is_ea_growing_a_concrete_study_idea_to_find_out/">original post by Peter Hurford</a> that his post answered had asked for that data. So I thought this would be a good set of events to look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>GWWC pledge drive 2014&ndash;2015: a few weeks around 1/1/2015: Traffic was lower in January than December, but it's hard to isolate the effects of the GWWC Pledge Drive from the general Giving Season cycle.<br /><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-end-2014-giving-season.png" alt="Google Analytics pageviews for end 2014 Giving Season" width="600" height="219" /></li>
<li>GWWC pledge drive 2015&ndash;2016: a few weeks around 1/1/2016: Same comment as for the previous pledge drive.<br /><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-end-2015-giving-season.png" alt="Google Analytics for end of 2015 Giving Season" width="600" height="225" /></li>
<li>EA Global 2015: 7/31-8/2, 2015 (SF), 8/14-8/16 (Melbourne), 8/28-8/30 (Oxford): Traffic was lower during the days of the summits than the surrounding days. This could be due to it being a weekend. It could be because the in-person event substituted for website visits and reduced the amount of content being posted. Overall, traffic in August was the same as July, so it doesn't seem like EA Global increased traffic to EAF in the surrounding days. Moreover, most of the pages that were visited during these events were qualitatively similar to the pages that were visited before and after them. The main exception was the <a href="//ea/lr/august_open_thread_ea_global/">August open thread</a>, that got a total of 304 views, most of them in the days right after the event ended. The view count for this was too small to meaningfully affect overall traffic.<br /><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-eag-2015.png" alt="Google Analytics July/August 2015 traffic, around the time of EA Global" width="600" height="227" /><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-eag-2015-open-thread.png" alt="Google Analytics EAG 2015 Open Thread" width="600" height="226" /></li>
<li>Doing Good Better published: 7/28/2015 (around the same time as EA Global): Traffic was higher on this day but the qualitative pattern of posts viewed wasn't different from other days, suggesting that the publication of the book wasn't the driving factor for the traffic increase.</li>
<li>The Most Good You Can Do published: 3/15/2015 (published on Amazon 4/7/2015): Traffic moved up and down around this time and there wasn't a clear effect on overall traffic. The qualitative nature of articles visited also didn't change. Note that this is in contrast with the <a href="http://www.wikipediatrends.com/Effective_altruism.html">Wikipedia page for effective altruism</a>, where the publication of the book approximately marked a permanent increase in the traffic level to the article.<br /><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-tmgycd.png" alt="Google Analytics March/April 2015 traffic, around release of Peter Singer's book" width="600" height="222" /></li>
<li>GiveWell top charities announced (2015&ndash;2016): 11/20/2015 (corrected date from source): Also hard to isolate the effect of this relative to Giving Season changes. Looking at traffic to posts with GiveWell in the title, we see spikes at various points in time related to posts about GiveWell, but these don't correspond to the timing of GiveWell's recommendation release.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="post-traffic-lifecycle-norms-and-exceptions">Post traffic lifecycle: norms and exceptions</h3>
<p>The vast majority of EAF posts get the vast majority of their traffic within a few days of publication. Typical examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/ea/146/president_trump_as_a_global_catastrophic_risk/">President Trump as a Global Catastrophic Risk<br /><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-post-trump-gcr.png" alt="Google Analytics traffic: President Trump as a Global Catastrophic Risk" width="600" height="226" /></a></li>
<li><a href="/ea/jv/introducing_effective_altruism_policy_analytics/">Introducing Effective Altruism Policy Analytics: Request for help and expert consultation<br /></a><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-post-introducing-eapa.png" alt="Google Analytics for post &quot;Introducing Effective Altruism Policy Analytics: Request for help and expert consultation&quot;" width="600" height="223" /></li>
<li><a href="/ea/sm/ea_is_elitist_should_it_stay_that_way/">EA is elitist. Should it stay that way?<br /></a><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-post-ea-elitist.png" alt="Google Analytics traffic for post &quot;EA is Elitist. Should it stay that way?&quot;" width="600" height="224" /></li>
</ul>
<p>However, the top viewed items of all time display a different pattern.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-top-posts-all-time.png" alt="Top posts of all time according to Google Analytics" width="600" height="377" /></p>
<p>although they do have more views around the time of initial publication, they continue to receive a steady stream of views long after they are published. Below is a list of the five top viewed articles of all time, with qualitative explanations of their view pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/ea/6x/introduction_to_effective_altruism/">Introduction to Effective Altruism</a>, averaged about 50 pageviews a day from mid-2015 to August 2016, and then dropped to about 10 pageviews a day ((probably due to competition from <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/">Introduction to Effective Altruism on effectivealtruism.org</a>).<br /><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-post-intro-to-ea.png" alt="Google Analytics for post &quot;Introduction to Effective Altruism&quot;" width="600" height="226" /></li>
<li><a href="/ea/6u/the_drowning_child_and_the_expanding_circle/">The Drowning Child and the Expanding Circle</a> sees traffic in waves, with sudden spikes after some sort of media publicity and then gradual decay over time, till the next spike.<br /><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-post-drowning-child.png" alt="Google Analytics for post: &quot;The Drowning Child and the Expanding Circle&quot;" width="600" height="224" /></li>
<li><a href="/ea/45/what_is_effective_altruism/">What is Effective Altruism?</a> had a traffic spike in July 2015, after which it saw 20 pageviews a day for a while. The number has decayed gradually and is now about 5 a day. <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=what%20is%20effective%20altruism">Search query competition</a> could explain the decline.<br /><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-post-what-is-ea.png" alt="Google Analytics for post &quot;What is Effective Altruism?&quot;" width="600" height="225" /></li>
<li><a href="/ea/5e/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/">Efficient charity: do unto others...</a> spiked in late January 2016, and has since fluctuated, averaging between 2 and 15 pageviews a day.<br /><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-post-efficient-charity.png" alt="Google Analytics for post &quot;Efficient charity: do unto others&quot;" width="600" height="225" /></li>
<li><a href="/ea/c8/should_you_donate_to_the_wikimedia_foundation/">Should you donate to the Wikimedia Foundation?</a> had three spikes: one at the time of initial writing (in late March 2015), and two more during the Giving Seasons of 2015 and 2016, coinciding with the Wikimedia Foundation fundraisers through Wikipedia banners. Disclosure: I wrote this post, and have spent some time understanding its view statistics.<br /><img src="https://files.vipulnaik.com/eaf/google-analytics-post-donate-wikimedia.png" alt="Google Analytics for post &quot;Should you donate to the Wikimedia Foundation?&quot;" width="600" height="224" /></li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the top five, the picture becomes more mixed. The sixth and seventh article, namely <a href="/ea/x4/philosophical_critiques_of_effective_altruism_by/">Philosophical Critiques of Effective Altruism by Prof Jeff McMahan</a> and <a href="/ea/4r/cheerfully/">Cheerfully</a>, had only one spike at time of publication, but do still get a very slow but still steady trickle of traffic. In eighth place is the wide-interest article <a href="/ea/fh/six_ways_to_get_along_with_people_who_are_totally/">Six Ways To Get Along With People Who Are Totally Wrong*</a>. This has had three big spikes and a much much smaller steady stream of articles. In ninth position is <a href="/ea/12z/concerns_with_intentional_insights/">Concerns with Intentional Insights</a>, which has had only one huge and short-lived spike, but given its recency, it could have more spikes later.</p>
