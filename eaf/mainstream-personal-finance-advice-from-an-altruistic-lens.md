# Mainstream personal finance advice from an altruistic lens

Of late, I've been watching a wide variety of personal finance YouTube
and getting familiar with many of the key concepts. Searching around
on the Effective Altruism Forum, I've found very little discussion of
the concepts and jargon from mainstream personal finance, though I
have found some dicussion of related ideas, often without a much
allusion to the mainstream versions of the ideas. So, in this post, I
aim to go over the mainstream personal finance ideas in some detail,
then evaluate them from an altruistic lens and compare and contrast
them with similar discussions on the Effective Altruism Forum and in
related communities.

## A summary of the core pieces of mainstream personal finance advice

### A few "sets of steps" from mainstream personal finance

One of the most widely known and widely influential personal finance
guides is [Dave Ramsey's 7 Baby
Steps](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/dave-ramsey-7-baby-steps). The
programs offered by Ramsey Solutions, built around these steps, have
been fairly influential in the United States and have been credited as
helping a lot of people get out of debt and build wealth. Here are the
7 steps:

1. "Baby emergency fund" / "starter emergency fund": Save $1,000 for
   your starter emergency fund.
2. "Debt-free": Pay off all debt (except the house) using the debt
   snowball (i.e., focus on the debts one by one, from smallest to
   largest, making minimum monthly payments on the other debts).
3. "Fully funded emergency fund": Save 3–6 months of expenses in a
   fully funded emergency fund.
4. Invest 15% of your household income in retirement.
5. Save for your children’s college fund.
6. Pay off your home early.
7. Build wealth and give.

Largely similar (though with some important differences) is the
[Financial Order of Operations from The Money
Guy](https://learn.moneyguy.com/financial-order-of-operations-course);
this too is tailored to a United States audience, though much of it is genericq:

1. Deductibles (this corresponds to the "baby emergency fund" /
   "starter emergency fund" i.e., step 1 in Ramsey's 7 steps): Save
   enough cash to cover unexpected emergencies; specifically, save
   enough to cover the deductibles for your insurance policies.
2. Employer Match (this is not explicitly called out as a separate
   step in the Rampsey's 7 steps, but fits in as part of step 4): Use
   the full employer match for your company-sponsored retirement plan.
3. High-Interest Debt (this corresponds to step 2 in Ramsey's 7 baby
   steps): Pay off your high-interest debt.
4. Emergency Reserves (this corresponds to "fully funded emergency
   fund" i.e., step 3 in Ramsey's 7 baby steps): Save at least 3-6
   months of living expenses.
5. Roth and HSA Contributions (this corresponds to part of step 4 in
   Ramsey's 7 baby steps): Take advantage of these tax-free growth
   tools.
6. Max out retirement accounts (this corresponds to part of step 4 in
   Ramsey's 7 baby steps)
7. Hyper-Accumulation (this corresponds to part of step 4 of Ramsey's
   baby steps): Save 20-25% of your gross income.
8. Pre-paid Future Expenses (this corresponds to step 5 of Ramsey's
   baby steps, though it's more open-ended): Save in advance for
   future expenses, such as your child's college fund.
9. Low-Interest Debt Pre-payment (this corresponds to step 6 of
   Ramsey's baby steps, though it's more open-ended)

Another multi-step plan doing the rounds is
[S.T.R.I.P.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-rich-strip-rich-bff-110000473.html)
from personal finance content creator Vivian Tu (known as Your Rich
BFF):

1. "S" stands for Savings: Have 3-6 months of savings tucked away
   (this corresponds to the "fully funded emergency fund" in Ramsey's
   7 baby steps).

2. "T" stands for Total Debt: Pay down from debts from highest to
   lowest interest rate (this is called the "avalanche method" of debt
   repayment).

3. "R" stands for Retirement: Contribute to your retirement accounts.

4. "I" stands for Investing: For instance, this could mean opening up
   a brokerage account and using it to invest in low-cost index funds.

5. "P" stands for Planning: Plan for your future, and figure out how
   much money you need to be able to sustain yourself indefitely
   (e.g., using the 4% withdrawal rate).

### Common themes

The exact details differ between different sets of steps; for
instance, the Ramsey steps are geared toward treating finances as a
behavioral / psychological matter, and are much more aggressive about
dealing with debt before starting to save. In contrast, the Financial
Order of Operations and S.T.R.I.P. take a more mixed approach, giving
the emergency fund and retirement savings a little more
importance. These differences reflect both the different origin
stories and the different target markets of the steps. In particular,
Ramsey's steps were born partly out of Dave Ramsey's experience
getting to a level of debt where he needed to file for bankruptcy, and
his advice is targeted to people seeking to escape a cycle of
debt. For contrast, the people behind the Financial Order of
Operations built experience advising a relatively better-off and more
financially savvy clientele.

Despite some of these differences, the core components of the plans
are very similar: get rid of debt, build an emergency fund, save for
retirement, and build wealth.

### The altruistic lens

In the EA Forum where I'm posting this article, many people view the
world, and their own activities in the world, with a more
altruistically demanding lens. I think there are a few key aspects of
these differences:

1. Significantly greater weight to giving away wealth (or sacrificing
   the *potential to earn wealth*) to create things of social value:
   To unpack this, the EA community assigns value both to donating
   wealth and to making life choices where one forgoes the opportunity
   to make more money, to do things believed to be more socially
   valuable. A lot of mainstream personal finance advice isn't really
   *geared* for this, even though it doesn't explicitly contradict
   having such a value system.

2. Haste considerations for donating, i.e., greater social returns on
   donations than personal returns on investment: In mainstream
   personal finance, there's an argument for accumulating wealth,
   because the historical return on investment in the market is
   positive, and (arguably) overcomes most people's discount rate for
   the future. However, in the EA community, many people hold beliefs
   of the broad flavor that donating in the next few years will yield
   more social returns than letting the money grow in the market, and
   investing it a few decades later. There are various reasons for
   these beliefs; one example of such a belief is the belief that the
   risk of disruptive AI in the next 10-20 years is nontrivial.

3. Potentially more search costs and time, both for donating money and
   for finding the right job: For those interested in finding jobs
   that they see as providing direct value, the search for the right
   job can be more challenging, since the set of such jobs is more
   limited and competition for them could be intense. For those
   looking to donate money, the search for the right place to direct
   one's money could be more challenging than for a more mainstream
   donor.

With this background, I'm going to look at different components of
mainstream personal finance advice, explaining my understanding of the
current consensus and areas of disagreement, and then talk about how
an altruistic lens can alter the way we think about it.

## Emergency fund

### Description of "emergency fund" in mainstream personal finance

An [emergency
fund](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/banking/emergency-fund-why-it-matters)
is a pool of money, generally in a liquid and low-risk form (such as a
high-yield savings account), that can be used to deal with
emergencies, that could be (a) unexpected expenses, or (b) unexpected
loss of income.

Mainstream personal finance advice generally recommends building up an
emergency fund up to some target amount, that is generally based on a
certain number of months of living expenses for the individual or
couple in question, plus any dependent family members. We'll talk
shortly about *how many months* of expenses this should work out to in
practice. Once the emergency fund reaches the targeted size, it is
called a "fully funded emergency fund"; the general advice in
mainstream personal finance is that once the emergency fund has
reached its target size, you shouldn't try to grow it further;
instead, you should focus on other financial goals such as saving for
retirement. However, if you do dip into the emergency fund, you should
top it up as soon as possible, back to the fully funded level.

Saving for an emergency fund differs from saving for other financial
goals in these respects:

1. Emergency funds should be stored in a liquid and low-risk form,
   such as a high-yield savings account, which often means that they
   are not in the form optimized for long-term growth. This
   distinguishes them from saving for retirement, that (unless you're
   going to retire very soon) *should* be in a form optimized for
   long-term growth rather than liquidity.

2. Emergency funds differ from saving for *planned* big expenses (such
   as buying a house, taking time off for a planned career change,
   having a child, etc.). A paradigm recommended when saving for
   planned big expenses is that of a [sinking
   fund](https://time.com/personal-finance/article/sinking-fund/).

### What does living expenses mean, and the wants/needs distinction

Mainstream personal finance categorizes expenses into "needs" and
"wants"; needs would mean the things you have to spend on to maintain
your day-to-day life, and wants are things you can cut back on. For
instance, rent would be a need, but in most cases, concert tickets
would be a want. Generally speaking, the "living expenses" used for
calculating the size of the emergency fund are supposed to only
include the "needs" portion of one's expenses. The idea here is that
if you do have an unexpected expense or unexpected loss of income, you
can put your "wants" on hold for a while while you recover from the
situation by drawing on the emergency fund.

#### On the EA Forum

In his [post on earning to
save](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/3ijnLaws7mCEogD6H/earning-to-save#R6n6GbYxxAJaeqPCs),
Raemon says that the living expenses used for calculating the
emergency fund should be:

> comfortable runway, not "living in your parent's basement" runway

which, in the language of mainstream personal finance, might be
interpreted as saying that the living expenses for emergency fund
calculation should include both needs and wants.

### How many months of expenses should a fully funded emergency fund cover?

Mainstream personal finance advice generally gives the target for a
fully funded emergency fund as "3-6 months of expenses" for emergency
fund; for instance, that's what is said in Ramsey's 7 baby steps, in
the Financial Order of Operations, in S.T.R.I.P., and in many online
articles about emergency funds (including the one linked
above). However, some others have suggested 6-12 months of living
expenses.

A [video from Debt Free
Millennials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTXc1P8pxac) goes into
more detail regarding how many months of living expenses an emergency
fund should cover. In addition to citing Ramsey's 3-6 months, the
video narraotr also mentions Ramit Sethi's 6-12 months, and ultimately
decides to split it down the middle and target 6 months for a fully
funded emergency fund.

#### On the EA Forum

80,000 Hours recommends [saving for 6-24
months](https://80000hours.org/2015/11/why-everyone-even-our-readers-should-save-enough-to-live-for-6-24-months/),
with 6-12 months intended to cover unexpected job loss and 12-18
months intended to cover intentional plans to switch careers. The
former fits more closely with the definition of emergency fund; the
latter may be though of more like a sinking fund.

In his [post on earning to
save](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/3ijnLaws7mCEogD6H/earning-to-save#R6n6GbYxxAJaeqPCs),
Raemon says:

> b) I think 6-12 months is not actually enough, 12-36 months is better

### What's up with capping off the emergency fund and switching savings energy elsewhere?

To me, the distinction between the emergency fund and sinking fund /
retirement savings feels somewhat arbitrary, though I also understand
thiat it has good uses I think it's worthwhile to parse out the
emergency fund concept a bit more, and understand how people are
coming up with these estimates such as 3-6 months, 6-12 months, 12-36
months, etc.

First, let's try to understand the mainstream personal finance
perspective. Mainstream personal finance is dealing with two kinds of
problems:

1. **Insufficient emergency funds**, leading to people being unable to
   handle emergencies, or going into high-interest debt to tackle
   emergencies: Mainstream personal finance advice therefore
   recommends building enough of an emergency fund so that unexpected
   emergencies don't lead people into debt.

2. **Insufficient retirement savings**: This is a little subtler to
   understand. Mainstream personal finance recommends having enough
   money by retirement age to cover 25 times annual spending (this is
   based on the idea of a 4% withdrawal rate). Basically the idea is
   that once you retire, your health could get worse over time, so if
   you retire at 65 with some amount of money, you don't want to run
   out of the money at age 80 while you still have some years left to
   live but are no longer healthy enough to do many kinds of work.

   Given earnings for the average person that mainstream personal
   finance is targeted at, achieving enough wealth by retirement to
   achieve this pretty much necessitates that the money be invested in
   something higher-return than a savings account, i.e., something
   like a low-cost index fund that tracks the overall stock
   market. Depending on the time and place, high-yield savings
   accounts offer somewhere between slightly negative and slightly
   positive inflation-adjusted interest rates, whereas the US stock
   market, over a multi-decade time period, offers 7%+
   inflation-adjustd annual interest rates.

So, (1) above leads to mainstream personal finance recommending the
emergency fund, but (2) above leads to mainstream personal finance
urging people to switch attention away from emergency funds and
towards retirement.

A likey contributing factor to mainstream personal finance's focus on
retirement savings is the tax advantages and employer matches provided
when explicitly earmarking savings for retirement. This might explain
the explicit focus on saving "for retirement" (through explicitly
earmarked retirement savings vehicles that can benefit from these
advantages) before trying to build a generic pool of wealth. While the
exact details of these tax advantages vary by country, they do exist
in some form across several countries.
