# Mainstream personal finance advice from an altruistic lens

Of late, I've been watching a wide variety of personal finance YouTube
and getting familiar with many of the key concepts. Searching around
on the Effective Altruism Forum, I've found very little discussion of
the concepts and jargon from mainstream personal finance, though I
have found some dicussion of related ideas, often without a much
allusion to the mainstream versions of the ideas. So, in this post, I
aim to go over the mainstream personal finance ideas in some detail,
then evaluate them from an altruistic lens and compare and contrast
them with similar discussions on the Effective Altruism Forum and in
related communities.

## A summary of the core pieces of mainstream personal finance advice

### A few "sets of steps" from mainstream personal finance

One of the most widely known and widely influential personal finance
guides is [Dave Ramsey's 7 Baby
Steps](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/dave-ramsey-7-baby-steps). The
programs offered by Ramsey Solutions, built around these steps, have
been fairly influential in the United States and have been credited as
helping a lot of people get out of debt and build wealth. Here are the
7 steps:

1. "Baby emergency fund" / "starter emergency fund": Save $1,000 for
   your starter emergency fund.
2. "Debt-free": Pay off all debt (except the house) using the debt
   snowball (i.e., focus on the debts one by one, from smallest to
   largest, making minimum monthly payments on the other debts).
3. "Fully funded emergency fund": Save 3–6 months of expenses in a
   fully funded emergency fund.
4. Invest 15% of your household income in retirement.
5. Save for your children’s college fund.
6. Pay off your home early.
7. Build wealth and give.

Largely similar (though with some important differences) is the
[Financial Order of Operations from The Money
Guy](https://learn.moneyguy.com/financial-order-of-operations-course);
this too is tailored to a United States audience, though much of it is
generic:

1. Deductibles (this corresponds to the "baby emergency fund" /
   "starter emergency fund" i.e., step 1 in Ramsey's 7 steps): Save
   enough cash to cover unexpected emergencies; specifically, save
   enough to cover the deductibles for your insurance policies.
2. Employer Match (this is not explicitly called out as a separate
   step in the Rampsey's 7 steps, but fits in as part of step 4): Use
   the full employer match for your company-sponsored retirement plan.
3. High-Interest Debt (this corresponds to step 2 in Ramsey's 7 baby
   steps): Pay off your high-interest debt.
4. Emergency Reserves (this corresponds to "fully funded emergency
   fund" i.e., step 3 in Ramsey's 7 baby steps): Save at least 3-6
   months of living expenses.
5. Roth and HSA Contributions (this corresponds to part of step 4 in
   Ramsey's 7 baby steps): Take advantage of these tax-free growth
   tools.
6. Max out retirement accounts (this corresponds to part of step 4 in
   Ramsey's 7 baby steps)
7. Hyper-Accumulation (this corresponds to part of step 4 of Ramsey's
   baby steps): Save 20-25% of your gross income.
8. Pre-paid Future Expenses (this corresponds to step 5 of Ramsey's
   baby steps, though it's more open-ended): Save in advance for
   future expenses, such as your child's college fund.
9. Low-Interest Debt Pre-payment (this corresponds to step 6 of
   Ramsey's baby steps, though it's more open-ended)

Another multi-step plan doing the rounds is
[S.T.R.I.P.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-rich-strip-rich-bff-110000473.html)
from personal finance content creator Vivian Tu (known as Your Rich
BFF):

1. "S" stands for Savings: Have 3-6 months of savings tucked away
   (this corresponds to the "fully funded emergency fund" in Ramsey's
   7 baby steps).

2. "T" stands for Total Debt: Pay down from debts from highest to
   lowest interest rate (this is called the "avalanche method" of debt
   repayment).

3. "R" stands for Retirement: Contribute to your retirement accounts.

4. "I" stands for Investing: For instance, this could mean opening up
   a brokerage account and using it to invest in low-cost index funds.

5. "P" stands for Planning: Plan for your future, and figure out how
   much money you need to be able to sustain yourself indefitely
   (e.g., using the 4% withdrawal rate).

### Common themes

The exact details differ between different sets of steps; for
instance, the Ramsey steps are geared toward treating finances as a
behavioral / psychological matter, and are much more aggressive about
dealing with debt before starting to save. In contrast, the Financial
Order of Operations and S.T.R.I.P. take a more mixed approach, giving
the emergency fund and retirement savings a little more
importance. These differences reflect both the different origin
stories and the different target markets of the steps. In particular,
Ramsey's steps were born partly out of Dave Ramsey's experience
getting to a level of debt where he needed to file for bankruptcy, and
his advice is targeted to people seeking to escape a cycle of
debt. For contrast, the people behind the Financial Order of
Operations built experience advising a relatively better-off and more
financially savvy clientele.

Despite some of these differences, the core components of the plans
are very similar: get rid of debt, build an emergency fund, save for
retirement, and build wealth.

### The altruistic lens

In the EA Forum where I'm posting this article, many people view the
world, and their own activities in the world, with a more
altruistically demanding lens. I think there are a few key aspects of
these differences:

1. Significantly greater weight to giving away wealth (or sacrificing
   the *potential to earn wealth*) to create things of social value:
   To unpack this, the EA community assigns value both to donating
   wealth and to making life choices where one forgoes the opportunity
   to make more money, to do things believed to be more socially
   valuable. A lot of mainstream personal finance advice isn't really
   *geared* for this, even though it doesn't explicitly contradict
   having such a value system.

2. Haste considerations for donating, i.e., greater social returns on
   donations than personal returns on investment: In mainstream
   personal finance, there's an argument for accumulating wealth,
   because the historical return on investment in the market is
   positive, and (arguably) overcomes most people's discount rate for
   the future. However, in the EA community, many people hold beliefs
   of the broad flavor that donating in the next few years will yield
   more social returns than letting the money grow in the market, and
   investing it a few decades later. There are various reasons for
   these beliefs; one example of such a belief is the belief that the
   risk of disruptive AI in the next 10-20 years is nontrivial.

3. Potentially more search costs and time, both for donating money and
   for finding the right job: For those interested in finding jobs
   that they see as providing direct value, the search for the right
   job can be more challenging, since the set of such jobs is more
   limited and competition for them could be intense. For those
   looking to donate money, the search for the right place to direct
   one's money could be more challenging than for a more mainstream
   donor.

With this background, I'm going to look at different components of
mainstream personal finance advice, explaining my understanding of the
current consensus and areas of disagreement, and then talk about how
an altruistic lens can alter the way we think about it.

## Debt

Mainstream personal finance [generally separates
debt](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/good-debt-vs-bad-debt-whats-the-difference/)
into "bad debt" -- the kind of debt you ideally shouldn't get into,
and that you should try to get out of as quickly as possible, and
"good debt" -- the kind of debt that it might be reasonable to get
into, and that you shouldn't necessarily be in a rush to get rid of.

The most significant form of bad debt is consumer debt; this could be
in the form of credit card debt that is accruing interest (i.e., it is
past its initial interest-free period), financed payments that are
accruing interest (where you borrow money for a specific expense from
a lender and have to pay it off in installments), and payday
loans. Consumer debt is generally characterized by very high interest
rates, notably, interest rates that are significantly higher than the
long-term return from the stock market.

Mainstream personal finance is reasonably unanimous that you should
try to not get into bad debt if you can avoid it (and that's why it is
important to build an emergency fund to handle emergencies), and also
that you should aggressively try to pay off your accumulated bad
debt.

The distinguishing feature of "good debt" is that it is debt that is
taken to help build wealth. Examples of "good debt" include
mortgages/home loans (that help build ownership of real estate), auto
loans (that help build ownershipd of a car), and student loans (that
help with the acquisition of skills that increase earning
potential). Of course, even a debt that falls in the "good debt"
category may, in a specific situation, have been a bad idea, because
the asset acquired by taking on the debt wasn't valuable enough to
justify the debt. For instance, a student loan taken to acquire a
degree that turned out to have no job market value.

Also, "good debt" *generally* has lower interest rates that are in the
ballpark of the market rate of return (and sometimes even lower!).

Mainstream personal finance is less unanimous about whether you should
take debts that fall in the good debt category, and how aggressively
you should pay them off. The Dave Ramsey steps discourage taking on
any form of debt other than a mortgage, so in particular that school
of thought recommends using cash to buy cars, and cash-flowing your
education (i.e., paying your way through college to the extent that
parents and scholarships can't cover all your expenses). On the other
hand, many other mainstream personal finance experts suggest that if
the good debt in question has a lower interest rate than the market
rate of return, there's no point paying the debt off quickly, and one
should instead make minimum monthly payments.

### Debt and the altruistic lens

I think that on this point, mainstream personal finance is basically
right. I don't think there is much that the altruistic lens has to add
on this.

I also haven't seen these topics discussed much in the EA community,
which might be a reflection of the fact that many people in the
community consider these points obvious and not even worth discussing.

I think it might be worth discussing / reiterating these points at the
appropriate places, such as when people are being asked to sign
donation pledges. The Giving What We Can pledge [briefly mentions
debt](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/en-US/pledge#faqhow-does-debt-change-my-giving-pledge):

> How does debt change my giving pledge?
>
> People taking a giving pledge should consider whether they will be
> able to donate their pledged amount while handling debt (such as
> student loans or a mortgage). Debt does not change the pledged
> amount as long as you have a regular income.

It's interesting that the two examples of debt included in this
example are both "good debt"; it looks like the language doesn't even
seem to consider the possibility of people having significant amounts
of bad debt.

## Emergency fund

### Description of "emergency fund" in mainstream personal finance

An [emergency
fund](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/banking/emergency-fund-why-it-matters)
is a pool of money, generally in a liquid and low-risk form (such as a
high-yield savings account), that can be used to deal with
emergencies, that could be (a) unexpected expenses, or (b) unexpected
loss of income.

Mainstream personal finance advice generally recommends building up an
emergency fund up to some target amount, that is generally based on a
certain number of months of living expenses for the individual or
couple in question, plus any dependent family members. We'll talk
shortly about *how many months* of expenses this should work out to in
practice. Once the emergency fund reaches the targeted size, it is
called a "fully funded emergency fund"; the general advice in
mainstream personal finance is that once the emergency fund has
reached its target size, you shouldn't try to grow it further;
instead, you should focus on other financial goals such as saving for
retirement. However, if you do dip into the emergency fund, you should
top it up as soon as possible, back to the fully funded level.

Saving for an emergency fund differs from saving for other financial
goals in these respects:

1. Emergency funds should be stored in a liquid and low-risk form,
   such as a high-yield savings account, which often means that they
   are not in the form optimized for long-term growth. This
   distinguishes them from saving for retirement, that (unless you're
   going to retire very soon) *should* be in a form optimized for
   long-term growth rather than liquidity.

2. Emergency funds differ from saving for *planned* big expenses (such
   as buying a house, taking time off for a planned career change,
   having a child, etc.). A paradigm recommended when saving for
   planned big expenses is that of a [sinking
   fund](https://time.com/personal-finance/article/sinking-fund/).

### What does living expenses mean, and the wants/needs distinction

Mainstream personal finance categorizes expenses into "needs" and
"wants"; needs would mean the things you have to spend on to maintain
your day-to-day life, and wants are things you can cut back on. For
instance, rent would be a need, but in most cases, concert tickets
would be a want. Generally speaking, the "living expenses" used for
calculating the size of the emergency fund are supposed to only
include the "needs" portion of one's expenses. The idea here is that
if you do have an unexpected expense or unexpected loss of income, you
can put your "wants" on hold for a while while you recover from the
situation by drawing on the emergency fund.

#### In the EA-sphere

In his [post on earning to
save](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/3ijnLaws7mCEogD6H/earning-to-save#R6n6GbYxxAJaeqPCs),
Raemon says that the living expenses used for calculating the
emergency fund should be:

> comfortable runway, not "living in your parent's basement" runway

which, in the language of mainstream personal finance, might be
interpreted as saying that the living expenses for emergency fund
calculation should include both needs and wants.

### How many months of expenses should a fully funded emergency fund cover?

Mainstream personal finance advice generally gives the target for a
fully funded emergency fund as "3-6 months of expenses" for emergency
fund; for instance, that's what is said in Ramsey's 7 baby steps, in
the Financial Order of Operations, in S.T.R.I.P., and in many online
articles about emergency funds (including the one linked
above). However, some others have suggested 6-12 months of living
expenses.

A [video from Debt Free
Millennials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTXc1P8pxac) goes into
more detail regarding how many months of living expenses an emergency
fund should cover. In addition to citing Ramsey's 3-6 months, the
video narrator also mentions Ramit Sethi's 6-12 months, and ultimately
decides to split it down the middle and target 6 months for a fully
funded emergency fund.

#### In the EA-sphere

80,000 Hours recommends [saving for 6-24
months](https://80000hours.org/2015/11/why-everyone-even-our-readers-should-save-enough-to-live-for-6-24-months/),
with 6-12 months intended to cover unexpected job loss and 12-18
months intended to cover intentional plans to switch careers. The
former fits more closely with the definition of emergency fund; the
latter may be though of more like a sinking fund.

In his [post on earning to
save](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/3ijnLaws7mCEogD6H/earning-to-save#R6n6GbYxxAJaeqPCs),
Raemon says:

> b) I think 6-12 months is not actually enough, 12-36 months is better

### What's up with capping off the emergency fund and switching savings energy elsewhere?

To me, the distinction between the emergency fund and sinking fund /
retirement savings feels somewhat arbitrary, though I also understand
thiat it has good uses. So I think it's worthwhile to parse out the
emergency fund concept a bit more, and understand how people are
coming up with these estimates such as 3-6 months, 6-12 months, 12-36
months, etc.

1. **Insufficient emergency funds**, leading to people being unable to
   handle emergencies, or going into high-interest debt to tackle
   emergencies: Mainstream personal finance advice therefore
   recommends building enough of an emergency fund so that unexpected
   emergencies don't lead people into debt.

2. **Insufficient retirement savings**: This is a little subtler to
   understand. Mainstream personal finance recommends having enough
   money by retirement age to cover 25 times annual spending (this is
   based on the idea of a 4% withdrawal rate). Basically the idea is
   that once you retire, your health could get worse over time, so if
   you retire at 65 with some amount of money, you don't want to run
   out of the money at age 80 while you still have some years left to
   live but are no longer healthy enough to do many kinds of work.

   Given earnings for the average person that mainstream personal
   finance is targeted at, achieving enough wealth by retirement to
   achieve this pretty much necessitates that the money be invested in
   something higher-return than a savings account, i.e., something
   like a low-cost index fund that tracks the overall stock
   market. Depending on the time and place, high-yield savings
   accounts offer somewhere between slightly negative and slightly
   positive inflation-adjusted interest rates, whereas the US stock
   market, over a multi-decade time period, offers 7%+
   inflation-adjustd annual interest rates.

So, (1) above leads to mainstream personal finance recommending the
emergency fund, but (2) above leads to mainstream personal finance
urging people to switch attention away from emergency funds and
towards retirement.

A likey contributing factor to mainstream personal finance's focus on
retirement savings is the tax advantages and employer matches provided
when explicitly earmarking savings for retirement. This might explain
the explicit focus on saving "for retirement" (through explicitly
earmarked retirement savings vehicles that can benefit from these
advantages) before trying to build a generic pool of wealth. While the
exact details of these tax advantages vary by country, they do exist
in some form across several countries.

### Revisiting the number of months for a fully funded emergency fund, without the altruistic lens

Here's my take, evaluating the number of months for a fully funded
emergency fund, but *without* the altruistic lens and with the
assumption (that is in the background of mainstream personal finance)
that the long-term rate of return of the stock market will remain
roughly what it has been in the past century.

To me, this comes down to a trade-off: do you build more of an
emergency fund and derisk your near-term future, versus do you save
more in (perhaps tax-advantaged, if feasible) retirement accounts, and
derisk your post-retirement life?

Here are a few criteria I'd use:

1. If your expected career trajectories and life choices are such that
   you *need* to rely on the stock market's rate of return in order to
   save enough for retirement, then you should stick to having an
   emergency fund at the relatively low end (something like 6
   months). However, if your expected career trajectories and life
   choices are such that just putting your savings in a high-yield
   savings account would let you have enough for retirement, you
   should probably build a larger emergency fund in the near term,
   giving you more short-term flexibility (something like 12 months).

2. If you are in a "thick" job market, i.e., one with lots of job
   openings, you can get away with a relatively small emergency fund
   (something like 6 months). If you are in a thin job market, where
   there are very few job openings, you should have a larger emergency
   fund, because it may take longer to recover from job
   loss. Depending on the thinness of the job market, you may even
   want something like a 3-year emergency fund.

3. If you have steady income (e.g., as a fixed-salary employee) in
   your current job and in potential jobs you can get if you lose your
   current one, you can get away with a small emergency fund. If you
   have variable income, you may want to augment your emergency fund
   to cover the seasonal variability.

4. If you're in a job that relies on skills that you lose quickly as
   you age, or where you're more prone to injury that may lead you to
   be unable to work, you may wish to keep a larger emergency fund. An
   example that might fit both criteria is that of a sports player.

5. If you have tendencies for chronic diseases or health issues, you
   should focus on building a large emergency fund. Having money in a
   locked retirement account won't help you treat chronic health
   issues as a young person, and won't help you tide over the loss of
   income in those scenarios. And if you don't survive that time
   period, you won't live to retirement age anyway!

On the whole, my take is: 6 months if you're in the best fit for the
scenario: don't earn much so you need that stock market growth rate to
be able to retire, you're in a thick job market, you have steady
income potential, your job doesn't rely on skills that you age out of
quickly, your job doesn't expose you to high injury risk, and you
don't have chronic health conditions. I'd add a few months for each of
these conditions that you violate.

### Adding in the altruistic lens

The altruistic lens has a few important effects:

* Connecting to point (2) above, if you want to do a job you directly
  consider highly impactful, the "job market" you're effectively in is
  a *lot* thinner than otherwise (this has been noted specifically in
  the context of the EA community, e.g.,
  [here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jmbP9rwXncfa32seH/after-one-year-of-applying-for-ea-jobs-it-is-really-really)). This
  is a strong argument for maintaining a much larger emergency fund,
  so that running out of money doesn't become the bottleneck / reason
  for giving up on the high-impact jobs and settling for a
  lower-impact job.

* To the extent that you see your job as a way to do good, you want to
  not be financially tied to your job. Specifically, if you feel your
  employer is behaving unethically, or just is not having the sort of
  positive impact that you envisioned when you joined, you may want to
  quit; these altruistic / prosocial motivations for quitting may
  matter more when you are looking at the situation with an altruistic
  lens. When you have to make that sort of decision, you don't want
  uncertainty about your own financial future to get in your way. So,
  having a larger emergency fund may be more important here.

### Does community social insurance reduce the need for an emergency fund?

One argument that has been brought up often in the EA Forum is the
idea that every individual building their own emergency fund is
inherently wasteful and duplicative; instead, community social
insurance to help cover expenses for people temporarily out of work
could mean much less in total spending. For instance, the [80,000
Hours
post](https://80000hours.org/2015/11/why-everyone-even-our-readers-should-save-enough-to-live-for-6-24-months/)
says:

This is a good argument and is valid in at least some cases, and it
has the obvious limitations that the 80,0000 Hours post
notes. Overall, I think having some form of community social insurance
is good, and it can definitely help with some cases of unexpected
individual loss of income. At the same time, I think exclusively
relying on it is a bad idea, because it can further raise the relative
costs of "whistleblowing" by being critical of the community, or even
of simply changing one's mind about values that the community holds
dear, to the extent that it will make the community stop insuring you.

So yes, I think community social insurance, to the extent it exists,
does reduce the amount needed for the emergency fund, but on balance
I'd still say that for those looking at the matter altruistically, the
emergency fund should be *at least as much* as it should be for people
not looking at the matter altruistically.
