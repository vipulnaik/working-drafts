# [[uses::Tube lemma]]: Suppose <math>X</math> is a compact space and <math>Y</math> is a topological space. Then, given any open subset <math>U</math> of <math>X \times Y</math> containing <math>X \times \{ y \}</math> for some <math>y \in Y</math>, there exists an open subset <math>V</math> of <math>Y</math> such that <math>y \in V</math> and <math>X \times V \subseteq U</math>.

==Proof==

'''Given''': A compact space <math>X</math>, a paracompact space <math>Y</math>. <math>\{ U_i \}_{i \in I}</math> form an open cover of <math>X \times Y</math>.

'''To prove''': There exists a locally finite open refinement of the <math>U_i</math>s, i.e., an open cover <math>\{ Q_k \}_{k \in K}</math> of <math>X \times Y</math> such that:
* It is locally finite: For any point <math>(x,y) \in X \times Y</math>, there exists an open set <math>R</math> containing <math>(x,y)</math> that intersects only finitely many of the <math>Q_k</math>s.
* It refines <math>\{ U_i \}_{i \in I}</math>: Every <math>Q_k</math> is contained in one of the <math>U_i</math>s.

'''Proof''': Note that in the proof below, Step (4) has three aspects (locally finite, cover, and refinement) and different later steps use different aspects of Step (4), with the specific aspect used indicated parenthetically in the Previous steps used column.

Thus, <math>X \times P_j</math> is contained in a union of finitely many <math>U_i</math>s, and hence, is the union of its intersection with those <math>U_i</math>s.

| 6 || The open subsets of the form <math>(X \times P_j) \cap U_i</math> of Step (5) form an open cover of <math>X \times Y</math> that refines the <math>U_i</math>s (note that not every combination of <math>P_j</math> and <math>U_i</math> is included -- only the finitely many <math>U_i</math>s needed as in Step (5)). We will index this open cover by indexing set <math>K \subseteq I \times J</math>, and call it <math>\{ Q_k \}_{k \in K}</math>, where <math>Q_k = (X \times P_j) \cap U_i</math>. In particular, if <math>k = (i,j)</math>, then <math>Q_k \subseteq X \times P_j</math> and <math>Q_k \subseteq U_i</math>, and for any <math>j</math>, there are finitely many <math>k \in K</math> with the second coordinate of <math>k</math> equal to <math>j</math>. || || || Steps (4) (cover aspect), (5) || <math>\{ P_j \}_{j \in J}</math> cover <math>Y</math>, so <math>\{ X \times P_j \}_{j \in J}</math> cover <math>X \times Y</math>.

| 7 || The open cover <math>\{ Q_k \}_{k \in K}</math> of Step (6) is a locally finite open cover. In other words, for any <math>(x, y) \in X \times Y</math>, there is an open subset <math>R \ni (x,y)</math> such that <math>R</math> intersects only finite many <math>Q_k</math>s. || || || Steps (4) (locally finite aspect), (6) || <toggledisplay>Since <math>\{ P_j \}_{j \in J}</math> form a locally finite open cover of <math>Y</math> (Step (4)), there exists an open subset <math>S</math> of <math>Y</math> such that <math>S</math> contains <math>y</math> and <math>S</math> intersects only finitely many of the <math>P_j</math>s. Set <math>R  = X \times S</math>, so <math>R</math> is open in <math>X \times Y</math>. <math>R</math> therefore intersects only finitely many of the <math>X \times P_j</math>s. For any <math>Q_k</math>, with <math>k = (i,j)</math>, we have <math>Q_k \subseteq X \times P_j</math> by construction (Step (6)), so if <math>Q_k</math> intersects <math>R</math> so does <math>X \times P_j</math>. Thus, the <math>Q_k</math>s that intersect <math>R</math> must correspond to the finitely many <math>j</math>s for which <math>R</math> intersects <math>X \times P_j</math>. Since there are finitely many <math>k</math>s for each <math>j</math>, this gives that there are finitely many <math>Q_k</math>s intersecting <math>R</math>.</toggledisplay> || Wrap things up.
