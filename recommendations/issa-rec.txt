I've paid Issa $40,000+ for contract work over the past two years. My big takeaway: Issa Gets Things Done. I rely on him for drudgery, which he's often able to speed up through his coding skills with Python, SQL, shell scripting, and numerous other languages and frameworks. Where needed, he'll patiently get through mundane data entry with an eye for detail. I know I can bank on him for hard, bang-head-against-the-wall open-ended projects. Apart from thinking, coding, free-form article writing, and systematic tabulation, he shines at communicating and negotiating. He pushes back against unreasonable projects, and comes up with evidence-backed, better-for-all-sides alternatives to my ill-considered project proposals. He has proved an adept manager of both people and systems: he's helped me coordinate contract work tasks I give out to others, and he's helped manage and grow the codebases of many of my projects. He is good at toggling between nailing down the little details and stepping back to ponder the big picture. He's continually sharing ideas on a range of subjects, and offering solid critiques of my own. Work with Issa Rice to expand your imagination of what's possible and learn what it means to truly offload the work part of your projects and still feel the excitement of making progress on them!
